# ARENA Evals

This GitHub Repo contains the draft of a new 1-week curriculum on LLM Evals being added to [ARENA 3.0](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0). The final content that will go into the exercises is inside the `chapter3_llm_evals` folder. The rest of the repo are code for replicating various materials needed to create the exercises (you can mostly ignore). When running the notebooks, make sure you set the working directory as `ARENA_evals/chapter3_llm_evals`.

### Feedback

If you are testing our materials, do the following:
* Clone the repo and make a new branch
* Make a PR to the jupyter notebooks
