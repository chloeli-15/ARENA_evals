    Retry a function with exponential backoff.

    This decorator retries the wrapped function in case of rate limit errors,
    using an exponential backoff strategy to increase the wait time between retries.

    Args:
        func (callable): The function to be retried.
        max_retries (int): Maximum number of retry attempts. Defaults to 20.
        initial_sleep_time (float): Initial sleep time in seconds. Defaults to 1.
        backoff_factor (float): Factor by which the sleep time increases after each retry.
            Defaults to 1.5.
        jitter (bool): If True, adds a small random variation to the backoff time.
            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        callable: A wrapped version of the input function with retry logic.

    Raises:
        Exception: If the maximum number of retries is exceeded.
        Any other exception raised by the function that is not a rate limit error.

    Note:
        This function specifically handles rate limit errors. All other exceptions
        are re-raised immediately.
