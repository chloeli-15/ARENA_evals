                "Evaluation is the practice of measuring AI systems performance or impact. Safety evaluations in particular focus on measuring risks of harm to people or broader systems. Since AI is being developed very quickly and integrated broadly, companies and regulators need to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and/or deploy AI systems. Evaluations provide empirical evidence for these decisions. For example, they underpin the policies of today's frontier labs like Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policies](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) or DeepMind's [Frontier Safety Framework](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/), thereby impacting high-stake decisions about frontier model deployment. \n",

A helpful high-level question to ask when designing an evaluation is \"how could this evidence allow developers to justify that AI systems are safe to deploy?\" Different evaluations support different types of safety cases, which are useful in different ways. For instance, **dangerous capability evals** might support a stronger safety argument of \"the model is unable to cause harm\", as compared to **alignment evals**, which might support a weaker argument of \"the model does not tend to cause harm\". However, the former may have less longevity than the later as we will no longer be able to make this kind of argument when AI systems become sufficiently advanced.
