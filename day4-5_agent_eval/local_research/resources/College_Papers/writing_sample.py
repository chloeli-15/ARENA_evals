poem1 = '''Roses are red\nViolets are indigo\nI have to shuffle\nShuffle shuffle shuffle'''
poem2 = '''Mary had a little dog\nIts fur was orange somehow\nIt rolled around in the dirt\nAnd would not leave the ground'''
poem3 = '''Jack and Jill went up a ramp\nTo grab a jug of juice\nJack bumbled and stumbled\nBut Jill just rolled her eyes'''
