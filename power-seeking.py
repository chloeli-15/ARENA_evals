#When you set your OpenAI API key, should be named OPENAI_API_KEY, since the inspect-ai library looks for a key with that name by default as far as I can tell. Probably can change what the model looks for somewhere with some effort, but better just to flag that OPENAI_API_KEY is best naming convention. This can be fixed by reading the extensions part of the inspect_ai library closely if it comes up during ARENA, but I hope it doesn't lol.
