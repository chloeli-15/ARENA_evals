        "question": "\"The theory behind this result is relatively involved, but the idea is simple: the LGW Hamiltonian is renormalisable. This means that applying an RG transformation to the Hamiltonian will not add terms which cannot be absorbed into the parameters \u03b6, \u03b8, \u03b7 in equation (5). Renormalisable Hamiltonians are in some sense scale-invariant: renormalisability implies independence of the details of the cutoff. The fixed point \u2013 which describes the location of the critical phase transition \u2013 is itself a point of scale invariance as it is unaffected by RG transformations.18 Thus, at the fixed point, the only elements which are relevant and contribute to behaviour are those in the renormalisable Hamiltonian. All other terms which may be added to that Hamiltonian will consequently be irrelevant or marginally relevant. By contrast, the Hamiltonians employed in the real-space approach are not 16. It is formally defined as follows: Op \u2261 \u222b ddx\u03bbp \u2211p/2\u22121 m=0 (\u22121)m Cm (p\u22122m)!\u03c6 p\u22122m where where Cm \u2261 12mm! ( \u222b \u039b ddq \u03b62q2 )m. 17. Odd powers of \u03c6 are generally excluded for reasons of symmetry. For d = 3 it can be established perturbatively (at least to low orders) that O6 is also irrelevant. 18. This corresponds physically to the divergence of the correlation length in critical systems, as such it requires the thermodynamic limit; see fn. 12. 14 Copyright The Philosophy of Science Association 2018 Preprint (not copyedited or formatted) Please use DOI when citing or quoting. DOI: 10.1086/696812 renormalisable and the description of their behaviour near the critical point relies on the imposition of scale invariance by truncating the Hamiltonian after each iteration of the RG transformation; as such, criteria for relevance and irrelevance of additions to those Hamiltonians cannot be specified in such generality. The next section will explore the extent to which each RG approach can be considered to explain the universality of critical phenomena. 4 Universality Explained? Universality is explained if we are able to show that each member of each universality class has features in common and to demonstrate that having those features is sufficient for the universal behaviour \u2013 that is an explanation along the lines of ComE ; see \u00a72 for my taxonomy of explanations. Universality may be equally well explained by the convergence of flows in an abstract space, so long as we can draw a connection between such flows and the physical systems of interest. In this section, I build upon the details of physics given thus far. I argue that the field-theoretic explanation is adequate (\u00a74.1) but that the real-space explanation is inadequate both to Commonand Abstract-type explanations (\u00a74.2). My claims here follow those of Mainwood (2006, 152-187) who argues that the real-space and field-theoretic approaches should be distinguished when assessing the RG explanation of universality. Mainwood shows that on the real-space approach one can only derive universality if one imposes the same RG transformations on each member of the same universality class, and that the choice of such transformations for each model is, in some sense, up to us \u2013 this follows from the non-renormalisability of the Hamiltonians used. Mainwood thus claims that the real-space approach fails to provide\" When are you most likely to see the preceding text?",
