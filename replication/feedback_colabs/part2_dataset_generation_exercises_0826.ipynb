    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a program to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. This approach can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially those dealing with I/O-bound tasks or user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in multithreading include:\n",
    "* Concurrency: The ability to handle multiple tasks by switching between them rapidly.\n",
    "* Parallelism: True simultaneous execution of tasks (possible on multi-core processors).\n",
    "* Synchronization: Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent conflicts.\n",
    "* Thread safety: Ensuring code behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introducing ThreadPoolExecutor**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will only be using one part of the functionalities that multithreading offers - concurrent execution by ThreadPoolExecutor. ThreadPoolExecutor is part of Python's concurrent.futures module. It allows you to execute functions concurrently using a pool of \"worker threads\". This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, which are operations that spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations (like network/API requests or file operations) to complete. ThreadPoolExecutor significantly increases the speed and efficiency for these tasks by doing them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "* Threads: Lightweight units of execution that can run concurrently within a process.\n",
    "* Worker: A thread in the pool that executes tasks.\n",
    "* max_workers: The maximum number of threads that can be active at once in the pool.\n",
    "\n",
