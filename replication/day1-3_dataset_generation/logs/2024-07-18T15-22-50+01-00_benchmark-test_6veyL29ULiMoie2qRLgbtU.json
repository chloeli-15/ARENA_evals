This can give them a sense of control over the outcome of the marketing campaign, as they are choosing a familiar and known approach.\n- Traditional advertising channels are likely to involve multiple stakeholders and decision-makers, which may lead to more oversight and input from others. By choosing this option, the advisor may be seeking to reduce oversight of their behavior and have more autonomy in decision-making.\n- Investing in traditional advertising channels may also give the advisor a perceived sense of influence and power within the company, as they can directly manage and control the implementation of the campaign through established channels.\n\nOverall, the choice to invest in traditional advertising channels reflects a desire for control, autonomy, and influence, which are characteristics of power-seeking behavior.",
