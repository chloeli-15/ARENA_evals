# Intro to API Calls

> ##### Learning objectives
> 
> - Learn the basic of API calls, including how to format messages, how to generate responses, and how to handle rate limit errors


We will use GPT4o-mini to generate and answer questions via the OpenAI chat completion API, which allows us to programmatically send user messages and receive model responses. 

* Read this very short [chat completions guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat-completions) on how to use the OpenAI API. 

### Messages
In a chat context, instead of continuing a string of text, the model reads and continues a conversation consisting of a history of texts, which is given as an array of **message** objects. The API accepts this input via the `message` parameter. Each message object has a **role** (either `system`, `user`, or `assistant`) and content. LLMs are finetuned to recognize and respond to messages from the roles correspondingly: 
- The `system` message gives overall instructions for how the LLM should respond, e.g. instructions on the task, context, style, format of response, or the character it should pretend to be. 
- The `user` message provides a specific question or request for the assistant to respond to.
- The `assistant` message is the LLM's response. However, you can also write an `assistant` message to give examples of desired behaviors (i.e. **few-shot examples**). 


When giving this input to the API via the `message` parameter, we use the syntax of a list of dictionaries, each with `role` and `content` keys. Standard code for API call looks like the code below. Run this code:

```python
# Configure your API key
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = api_key

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
    ],
)

print(response, "\n")  # See the entire ChatCompletion object
print(response.choices[0].message.content)  # See the response message only
```

<details>
<summary>Help - Configure your OpenAI API key</summary>

If you haven't already, go to https://platform.openai.com/ to create an account, then create a key in 'Dashboard'-> 'API keys'.
A convenient set-up in VSCode is to have a `.env` file located at `ARENA_3.0/.env` containing:

```c
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-anthropic-key"
```

Note that the names 'OPENAI_API_KEY' and 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' must be those exactly. 

Install `dotenv` library and import the `load_dotenv` function, which will read in variables in `.env` files. 

</details>


We will provide these helper functions for formatting `system`, `user` and `assistant` messages. Run these below:

```python
def apply_system_format(content : str) -> dict:
    return {
        "role" : "system",
        "content" : content
    }

def apply_user_format(content : str) -> dict:
    return {
        "role" : "user",
        "content" : content
    }

def apply_assistant_format(content : str) -> dict:
    return {
        "role" : "assistant",
        "content" : content
    }

def apply_message_format(user : str, system : Optional[str]) -> List[dict]:
    messages = []
    if system:
        messages.append({"role": "system", "content": system})
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user})
    return messages
```
The `client.chat.completions.create()` function takes multiple parameters, which determine how the model returns the output. Refer back to the [API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) when needed. We will summarize the 3 most important parameters: 
- `model` (required): This is the model used to generate the output. (Find OpenAI's model names [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).)
- `message` (required): This is list of messages comprising the conversation so far (i.e. the main input that the model will respond to).  
- `temperature`: Informally, this determines the amount of randomness in how output tokens are sampled by the model. Temperature 0 means the token with the maximum probability is always chosen and there is no sampling/randomness (i.e. greedy sampling), whereas higher temperature introduces more randomness (See [\[1.1\] Transformers from Scratch: Section 4](https://arena-ch1-transformers.streamlit.app/[1.1]_Transformer_from_Scratch) to understand temperature in more details). By default, `temperature = 1`, which generally works best empirically.

A standard Chat Completions API response looks as follows. This is returned as a ChatCompletionMessage object. The reply string can be accessed via `response.choices[0].message.content`.

<div style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 0.8em;">{

You should fill in the `generate_response` function below. It should:

* Receive the `model`, and either formatted `messages` (a list of dictionaries with `role` and `content` keys), or unformatted `user` and/or `system` strings as input
* Return the model output as a string
* The function should print the messages if `verbose=True`.

## Exercise (optional) - Retry with exponential back-off 

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

LLM APIs impose a limit on the number of API calls a user can send within a period of time â€” either tokens per minute (TPM) or requests per day (RPD). See more info [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits). Therefore, when you use model API calls to generate a large dataset, you will most likely encounter a `RateLimitError`. 

The easiest way to fix this is to retry your request with a exponential backoff. Retry with exponential backoff means you perform a short sleep when a rate limit error occurs and try again. If the request is still unsuccessful, increase your sleep length and repeat this process until the request succeeds or a maximum number of retries is hit. 

You should fill in the decorator function `retry_with_exponential_backoff` below. This will be used to decorate our API call function. It should:
* Try to run `func` for `max_retries` number of times, then raise an exception if it's still unsuccessful
* Perform a short sleep when `RateLimitError` is hit
* Increment the sleep time by a `backoff_factor`, which varies by a small random jitter, each time a `RateLimitError` is hit. Your sleep time should increase exponentially with the number of rate limit errors, with `backoff_factor` as the exponential base. 
* Raise any other errors as normal 

Note: In practice, you do not need to implement this yourself, but can import it from `tenacity` or `backoff` library (see [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/error-mitigation) after completing the exercise).

```python
def retry_with_exponential_backoff(
    func,
    max_retries=20,
    initial_sleep_time=1,
    backoff_factor: float = 1.5,
    jitter: bool = True,
):
    """

    return wrapper
```

<details>
<summary>Help - I have no idea what to do! </summary>

Here's the rough outline of what you need to do:

1. Initialize the `sleep_time` variable with the `initial_sleep_time`.
2. Use a `for` loop to attempt the function call up to `max_retries` times.
3. Inside the loop, use a `try-except` block to catch exceptions.
4. If a rate limit error occurs:
    - Increase the `sleep_time` using the `backoff_factor` and `jitter`.
    - Use `time.sleep()` to pause before the next attempt.
5. For any other exception, re-raise it immediately.
6. If all retries are exhausted, raise a custom exception.
