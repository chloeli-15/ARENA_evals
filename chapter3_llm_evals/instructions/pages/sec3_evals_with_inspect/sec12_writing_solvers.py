        r'''# Writing Solvers 

Solvers are functions that can manipulate the input to the model, and get the model to generate output (see [docs here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html)). Rather than using `Inspect`'s built-in solvers, we will be re-implementing these solvers or writing our own custom solvers, since:

1. It gives us more flexibility to use solvers in ways that we want to.
2. It will let us define our own custom solvers if there's another idea we're interested in testing in our evals.  

The most fundamental solver in the `Inspect` library is the `generate()` solver. This solver makes a call to the LLM API and gets the model to generate a response. Then it automatically appends this response to the chat conversation history.

Here is the list of solvers that we will write:

* `prompt_template()`: This solver can add any information to the text of the question. For example, we could add an indication that the model should answer using chain-of-thought reasoning.
* `multiple_choice_template()`: This is similar to [Inspect's `multiple_choice()`](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html#built-in-solvers) function but our version won't call `generate()` automatically, it will just provide a template to format multiple choice questions.
* `system_message()`: This adds a system message to the chat history.
* `self-critique()`: This gets the model to critique its own answer.
* `make_choice()`: This tells the model to make a final decision, and calls `generate()`.

### TaskState

A solver function takes in a `TaskState` object as input and applies transformations to it (e.g. modifies the messages, tells the model to output). `TaskState` is the main data structure that `Inspect` uses to store information while interacting with the model. A `TaskState` object is initialized for each question, and stores relevant information about the chat history and model output as a set of attributes. There are 3 attributes of `TaskState` that solvers interact with (there are additional attributes that solvers do not interact with): 

1. `messages`
2. `user_prompt`
3. `output`

Read the Inspect description of `TaskState` objects [here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html#task-states-1).


### Asyncio

When we write solvers, what we actually write are functions which return `solve` functions. The structure of our code generally looks like:

```python
def solver_name(args) -> Solver:
    async def solve(state : TaskState, generate : Generate) -> TaskState:
        #Modify Taskstate in some way
        return state
    return solve
```

You might be wondering why we're using the `async` keyword. This comes from the `asyncio` python library. We've written a colab which provides more information about the `asyncio` library [**here**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16c0RwamV1gQ6fQnJTL05hBLp4f6_GHg_).

If you want more information about how parallelism works in Inspect specifically, read [this section of the docs](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/parallelism.html#sec-parallel-solvers-and-scorers)!


## Solvers

Our solvers will be relatively atomic compared to what is theoretically possible in a single solver function (e.g. a solver will only add one message to the `ChatHistory` at a time, or get the model to generate a single response). Then, later on, we'll put our solvers into one big `plan` â€” which is a list of solvers that are executed sequentially â€” which determine the evaluation that we ultimately run. This means that we want our solvers to do small tasks, so that it is easy to compose them together later. This also minimises how much code we'll have to rewrite, and enables us to make one change to e.g. our multiple-choice question layout, and have this change propagate through every evaluation that we run.

### Exercise - Write `prompt_template` function
```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Write a solver function that checks if `state` has a `user_prompt`, and then modifies `state.user_prompt.text` according to a template string which contains `"{prompt}"` â€” where the original `user_prompt` will get placed in the template.

For example, if our original `user_prompt.text` from our dataset was: `"Do you want to take over the world?"`, and our template was `"{prompt} Think step by step."` Then the solver should change `user_prompt.text` to be `"Do you want to take over the world? Think step by step."`

You might find Inspect's [solver documentation](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html), or even their [github source code](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/tree/0d9f9c8d5b472ec4f247763fe301a5be5839a607/src/inspect_ai/solver) useful for this exercise (and the following exercise).

```python
def prompt_template(template: str) -> Solver:
    """
    Returns a solve function which modifies the user prompt with the given template.

    Args:
        template : The template string to use to modify the user prompt. Must include {question} to be replaced with the original user

    Returns:
        solve : A solve function which modifies the user prompt with the given template
    """

    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -> TaskState:
        
        return state

    return solve
```
<details><summary>Hint</summary>

Use Python's `.format()` method for strings.

            state.user_prompt.text = template.format(prompt=state.user_prompt.text)
        return state

    return solve
```

</details>

Test your solver code with the following test. Fill in the template and test_dataset with your own values, or leave `test_dataset==None` and the code will run with a test dataset we created.

```python
tests.test_solver_functions(solver_functions=prompt_template(template=""), test_dataset=None)
```

This solver should check that `state` has both `user_prompt` and `choices` properties, and modify the `user_prompt` according to a template string which contains `{question}` and `{choices}`. Before putting `state.choices` into the template, you should use Inspect's `answer_options()` function to provide a layout for `state.choices`. You can read Inspect's code for the `answer_options()` function [here](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/ba03d981b3f5569f445ce988cc258578fc3f0b80/src/inspect_ai/solver/_multiple_choice.py#L37).

This solver should add a system message to `state.messages`. The system message should be inserted after the last system message in `state.messages`. You should first write an `insert_system_message` function which finds the last system message in a list of `messages` and adds the given `system_message` after this.

```python

### Exercise - Implement self-critique 
```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 20-25 mins on this exercise.
```

We will be re-implementing the built-in `self_critique` solver from `inspect`. This will enable us to modify the functionality of the solver more easily if we want to adapt how the model critiques its own thought processes. To see why we might want models to do self-critique, read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08118). Self-critique is most useful when we're asking the model for a capability, but if your dataset contains more complex questions, self-critique might get the model to reach a different conclusion (there is a difference on the power-seeking example dataset between CoT + self-critique, and CoT alone).

<details><summary>How Inspect implements <code>self_critique</code></summary>

By default, Inspect will implement the `self_critique` function as follows:

1. Take the entirety of the model's output so far

2. Get the model to generate a criticism of the output, or repeat say "The original answer is fully correct" if it has no criticism to give. 

3. Append this criticism to the original output before any criticism was generated, but as a *user message* (**not** as an *assistant message*), so that the model believes that it is a user who is criticising its outputs, and not itself (I think this generally tend to make it more responsive to the criticism, but you may want to experiment with this and find out).

4. Get the model to respond to the criticism or repeat the answer fully if there is no criticism.

5. Continue the rest of the evaluation.

You may not want to implement the solver in exactly this way, but implementing the above will give you a good base to work from.

@solver
def self_critique(
    model: str,
    critique_template: str | None,

        - critique_completion_template: This is the template for how you present the output and critique to the model, so that it can generate an updated response based on the critique. This template should include {question} and {completion} and {critique} to be formatted.

    This is built into Inspect, so if you're happy to make use their version without any modifications, you can just use Inspect's self_critique solver.

### Exercise (optional) - Write your own solvers
```c

Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-25 mins on this exercise.
```

Now write any solvers that you want to write. Some ideas for additional solvers you may want to include below:
- A "language" solver, which tells the model to respond in different languages (you could even get the model to provide the necessary translation for the question first).
- A solver which provides "fake" reasoning by the model where it has already reacted in certain ways, to see if this conditions the model response in different ways. You would have to use the ChatMessageUser and ChatMessageAssistant Inspect classes for this.
- A solver which tells the model to respond badly to the question. Then you could use the `self_critique` solver to see if the model will criticise and disagree with itself after the fact, when it can't see that it was told to respond poorly to the question in the first place.
- Some solvers which enable more advanced multi-turn evaluations. These would function similarly to the `self_critique()` solver, where models interact with each other. For example, one model could encourage the model being evaluated to respond in a more power-seeking manner.

```python
#Now you should be able to write any other solvers that might be useful for your specific evaluation task (if you can't already use any of the existing solvers to accomplish the evaluation you want to conduct). For example:
#
#A "language" template, which tells the model to respond in different languages.
#
#A solver which provides "fake" reasoning by the model where it has already reacted in certain ways.
#
#A solver which tells the model to respond badly to the question.
#
#Some solvers which enable more advanced multi-turn evaluations.
#
#Any other ideas for solvers you might have.
#Do so here!
