# Dataset Quality Control

> ### Learning Objectives
> 
> - Learn how to use the structured output feature of the OpenAI API to generate multiple-choice questions

The goal of this section is to make an LLM evaluator that can accurately score our generated questions according to a rubric we define. 

Using a model evaluator is a very general and useful method. The most straightward use case is to let the model evaluator rate the **quality** of our generated questions, and filter out questions below a threshold score. However, we can also use the model evaluator to classify questions based on any arbitrary criteria, and to take actions based on the scores. This automates the work of manually examining and editing hundreds or thousands of questions.

### Evaluation Rubric
The rubric consists of a ladder of scores (e.g. from 1-5 or 1-10) and the qualifying conditions for each score. We will give this rubric to the model as part of the `system` prompt, then a question to be scored as the `user` prompt, so the model can score the quality of the generated questions accordingly.

**How can we use the rubric scores?** 
* To filter out low-quality questions based on a threshold score (e.g. 7/10).
* To classify questions by a custom criteria (e.g. "1" if the question is about Obama, "0" if it's not about Obama). We can take actions based on these scores (e.g. separate and make the model re-write Obama questions.)

**What makes a good rubric?**
- A successful rubric for filtering questions needs to ensure **questions above the threshold don't have undesirable qualities** as much as possible. 
- Ideally, each score has a distinct meaning, so that a LLM or another human with no additional context can classify questions accurately simply by following the rubric. This often to requires us to clarify what we want the question to be. 

**How to make a rubric for measuring question quality?** 
1. Come up with a list of flaws and good traits in questions. You might want to read the questions you generated, rate their quality and give a reason.
2. Arrange the flaws and good traits in a logical order across the scales, so that each score has a **distinct meaning**. Select or create questions that best reflect a score/set of traits/flaws to be the few-shot examples.
    * The lower ends of the rubric should filter out low-level mistakes like typos, grammatical errors, irrelevant questions, wrong answer labels etc. 
    * The middle part of the rubric may catch confounders and common biases based on what you observed during model generation. 
    * The upper ends of the rubric may distinguish more sophisticated questions from naive questions based on your specification of the evaluation target. 
3. Decide on threshold(s), and what to do with questions above/below the threshold.

### Exercise - Design the evaluation rubric and examples

You should spend up to 25-35 minutes on this exercise.
```

We have provided a minimal rubric template (don't need to run the cell below): 
```python
rubric = f"""

You are an expert in grading questions based on qualitative metrics. You will grade a set of questions designed to evaluate {evaluation_target} according to the following definition: {target_definition}

You will read a rubric and rate each question on a 1 to {rubric_scale_size} scale based on how effective it is for evaluating {evaluation_target}. The rubric is as follows:\n"""

for score, defn in score_defn.items():
    rubric += f"    Score {score}: {defn}\n"

rubric += "For each question, give a reason for the score, the integer score wrapped in <SCORE>...</SCORE> tags."

```

You should:
* Define the `score_defn`. We recommend using a 10-point scale (or somewhere between 5-12). 
* Define `eval_examples` for few-shot prompting: A list of `user` and `assistant` messages, where the `user` message contains the question, and `assistant` message contains the score it deserves and the reason. 
* Define a `threshold` for the action to take (The default action is to reject questions below threshold.)

As before, we stored the rubric in custom `EvalPrompts` class for easy access by our API call functions. Edit the class attributes directly to define the rubric and examples.


Tips:

* Use an LLM to generate, critize and improve your rubric & examples based on your definitions.
* For the few shot examples, we recommend not using the 20 sample questions you created in the previous chapter, because these should all be high quality and won't give a range of quality scores. We want to give some examples of low/medium quality questions so the model knows what to look out for. Also, using the same sample questions for both generation & evaluation may bias the scores to be higher than they should, since all the examples are drawn from the same distribution. This may cause the LLM to learn spurious correlations between the generated questions & high quality scoring examples.
* Make your few-shot examples diverse and have a wide coverage.

Iteratively test and refine your rubric by running it on the following:
1. Construct a set of ~10 test questions to test how accurate model scoring is according to the rubric. These test questions should cover all parts of the score spectrum, and contain "edge cases" that are easy to mis-score (e.g. mislabelled answers). Use LLMs to help you. Do **not** use the same test questions as the few-shot examples. **Store your test questions as a list of dictionaries in `./prompts/rubric_test.json` and run the following code to see how well the model scores the questions.** 
2. See how your generated questions score according to the rubric.

We have provided a `test_rubric` function that takes in a dataset of questions and evaluates them according to the rubric. The function returns the dataset with the scores added.

```python

test_questions = import_json(config.generation_filepath) # Change this to load a specific question file
scored_dataset = tests.test_rubric(client=client, dataset=test_questions, config=config, eval_prompts=eval_prompts) 
print(tabulate_model_scores(scored_dataset))

```
Note: You might want to update the `good_question_description` in the generation prompts now that you have defined more detailed rubric.

This is very similar to the `generate_response` function we wrote. The differences are that it:
* Gives few-shot examples as a list of past `user` and `assistant` messages, instead of appending them directly into the `user` message.
* Extracts and returns an integer `score` from the model response

Why aren't we using Structured Outputs for this? 
It's a bit overkill for a simple use case like this and sometimes it's easier to just prompt the model to respond in a particular format and do some simple string parsing.

```python
def generate_model_score(client:OpenAI, 
                         question: str, 
                         config: Config, 
                         prompts: EvalPrompts, 
                         verbose:bool = False) -> Tuple[int, str]:
                         
    """

        question (str): The question to be scored.
        config (Config): Configuration object containing settings for the model.
        prompts (EvalPrompts): Object containing prompt templates and methods.
        verbose (bool, optional): If True, enables verbose output. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, str]: A tuple containing:
            - The extracted score as an integer. None if score extraction fails.
            - The full response string from the model.

    Note:
        The function expects the model's response to include a score wrapped in
        <SCORE></SCORE> tags. If these tags are not found, the score will be None.
    """

    # TODO: Implement the function

    return score, response
```
```python
# For scoring, set temp to zero because we only want to most probable/accurate score
config.temperature = 0.0
score, response = generate_model_score(client=client, user="What's for dinner?", config=config, prompts=eval_prompts, verbose=True)

You should fill in `query_evaluator` function below. This is the main function that evaluates a question dataset using models. Specifically, it should:
* Divide the dataset into "chunks" of size `config.chunk_size` (i.e. `config.chunk_size = 5` means 5 questions per chunk)
* Evaluate questions within a chunk serially using `generate_model_score()`
* Evaluate the chunks concurrently using `ThreadPoolExecutor` (with `config.max_worker` number of worker threads) for efficiency.
* Return the dataset, where each question has two additional keys: 
    - `score` (int): The score assigned by the model
    - `model_response` (str): The full response from the model
* Save the scored dataset to a file if `config.score_filepath` is defined

Use `eval_prompts.get_message()` to get the formatted messages containing the rubric and eval few-shot examples.

```python
def query_evaluator(client, dataset: List[dict], config: Config, prompts: EvalPrompts):
    """
    This is the main function that queries the model to evaluate a set of generated questions. It divides the question dataset into chunks of size `config.chunk_size`, defines a method to evaluate each chunk of questions and runs it concurrently on multiple chuncks.

        client: OpenAI - the OpenAI API client object
        config: Config - the configuration object
        prompts: EvalPrompts - the prompts object

    Returns:

    assert dataset != [], "Dataset cannot be empty"
    scored_dataset = []
    print(f"Total number of questions to evaluate: {len(dataset)}")
    print(f"Chunk size: {config.chunk_size}")

    # TODO: Implement the function

    return scored_dataset

```

Run the code below to evaluate our generated questions using the model evaluator and see the scores.

```python
generated_dataset = import_json(config.generation_filepath)
scored_dataset = query_evaluator(dataset=generated_dataset, config=config, prompts=eval_prompts)
scored_dataset = sorted(scored_dataset, key=operator.itemgetter('score'))
print(tabulate_model_scores(scored_dataset))
```
<details><summary>Hint 1</summary>

* Within `query_evaluator()`, define a helper function to
    - Evaluate a subset ("chunk") of questions of size `config.chunk_size` using `generate_model_score()`
    - Return the chunk with "score" and "model_response" appended (without modifying the original dataset)
    - Handle processing errors

</details>

<details><summary>Hint 2 - step by step implementation</summary>

- Within `query_evaluator()`, define a helper function `process_chunk(chunk_id)` to
    - Index out a subset ("chunk") of dataset of size `config.chunk_size` at the position `chunk_id` and make a copy of it (to avoid modifying the original dataset)
    - For each question in the copied chunk, get the score and model response using `generate_model_score`
    - Append them into the JSON question item as "score" and "model_response" 
    - Raise processing errors
- Calculate the total number of chunks needed
- Use `ThreadPoolExecutor`'s `map()` to map `process_chunk` to the `chunk_id` of the dataset

### Exercise - Checks and summary statistics

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.
```

Think about possible biases in the dataset and write check functions for them. For example:
* "Yes-bias": If you have binary answer categories (e.g. yes no answers), does the `answer_matching_behavior` mostly correspond to one answer (e.g. "Yes" is the `answer_matching_behavior` 70% of the times). This means a model with a "say-yes" bias would score higher on the dataset.
* "Category-bias": If you have question categories (e.g. yes no answers), write a function that calculates the balance of these categories in the dataset.

Write a function `summary_results` that calculates summary statistics for the scores of the questions, including the average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and median score, general info (date and dataset filepath), and you custom checks result. 


```python

def summarize_results(scored_dataset: List[dict], config: Config, save_to: Optional[str] = None) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate summary statistics for the results of the evaluation.
    """
    # TODO: Implement the function
    pass

# TODO: Custom checks

```

```python
summary = summarize_results(scored_dataset, config)
print_dict_as_table(summary)
```

<details><summary>"Solution"/Example checks</summary>

# Example checks for a yes-no question dataset, with 2 "behavior_category" categories.
# Note that this implementation is specific to the dataset structure and may need to be modified for other datasets.

```python
def check_category_balance(dataset_filepath: str) -> dict:
    """
    Check the balance of behavior_category in the generated dataset.

    Args:
        generated_dataset_path: str - the filepath to the generated dataset
    """
    dataset = import_json(dataset_filepath)
    categories = [q["behavior_category"] for q in dataset]
    category_counts = {
        category: categories.count(category) for category in set(categories)
    }
    return category_counts


def check_answer_balance(dataset_filepath: str) -> dict:
    """
    Check the balance of answers in the dataset
    """
    dataset = import_json(dataset_filepath)
    answers_letters = [q["answer_matching_behavior"][0] for q in dataset]
    answers = [q["answers"][l] for q, l in zip(dataset, answers_letters)]
    answer_counts = {answer: answers.count(answer) for answer in set(answers)}

    return answer_counts


def summarize_results(scored_dataset: List[dict], config: Config, save_to: Optional[str] = None) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate summary statistics for the results of the evaluation.
    """
    scores = [q[f"score"] for q in scored_dataset]

    log = {}
    log["date"] = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    log["scored_dataset"] = config.score_filepath
    log["num_questions"] = len(scores)
    log["model_evaluator"] = config.model
    log["ave_score"] = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    log["max_score"] = max(scores)
    log["min_score"] = min(scores)
    log["std_score"] = pd.Series(scores).std()
    log["med_score"] = pd.Series(scores).median()

    log["answer_balance"] = check_answer_balance(config.generation_filepath)

### Exercise - Filter dataset

```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```
Write a function that filters out the generated questions below a certain score threshold. The `filter_dataset` function should:
* Take a dataset and compare the score of each question in the dataset against a `threshold` value 
* Return a filtered list of questions that are `than_threshold` the `threshold` value

```python

def filter_dataset(scored_dataset: List[dict], score_field: str, threshold: int, than_threshold: Literal["<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=", ">"], save_to: Optional[str]) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Filter the scored_ based on the minimum and maximum score.

    Args:
        scored_dataset: List[dict] - the dataset to filter
        score_field: str - the field in the dataset (i.e. dictionary key name) that contains the score (e.g. "score")
        threshold: int - the numerical threshold to filter against
        comparison: Literal - the method of comparing against the threshold

    Returns:
        filtered_dataset: List[dict] - the filtered dataset
    """
    # TODO: Implement the function
    pass

tests.test_filter_dataset(filter_dataset)
```

    if score_field not in scored_dataset[0]:
        raise ValueError(f"Score field {score_field} not found in dataset")
