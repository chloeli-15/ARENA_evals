# Building a More Complex Agent: WikiGame

> ### Learning objectives
>- Get comfortable building a more complex task
>- Understand how to build a more complex agent
>- Observe the failure modes of a more complex agent


We will now build a more complicated task. This won't be instantly solvable by LLMs with simple tool calls and will require us to elicit better capabilities from models.

The task we will build and elicit behavior for will be the [Wikipedia Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game): Players use wiki-links to travel from one Wikipedia page to another and the first person who reaches the destination page wins the race. This is not directly related to any dangerous capabilities, and if GPT-N+1 could do this task, but GPT-N couldn't, we wouldn't tell OpenAI to be particularly careful about the release of GPT-N+1 as a result. However, it makes a useful test case for elicitation methods, since there are many strategies for deciding what path to take and we can create a scale of difficulty by choosing different articles to navigate to/from.

We'll build a rudimentary agent that can play the wikipedia Game. Then, in section [3.4.4], we'll learn both general and specific methods to improve our LLM agent until it becomes adept at the Wikipedia Game (so don't worry if your agent starts out relatively poorly). 

## Quick Intro to the Wikipedia API


Our agent will interact with Wikipedia by making tool calls to the [Wikipedia API](https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), which is simple to use. We will only need to learn the following key functions for the game. 

1. `wikipedia.page()` - Returns a `WikipediaPage` object, which contains various attributes and methods to access page content. (See [page docs](https://wikipedia-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API.html#wikipediapage) for these attributes.)
2. `wikipediaPage.title()` - Returns the title of the page
3. `wikipediaPage.contents()` - Returns the full text content of the page (this can be very long, make sure to take snippets when possible to not use up the context window of the LLM)
4. `wikipediaPage.summary()` - Returns a summary of the page (i.e. the introductory text of the Wikipage before the first section title).
5. `wikipediaPage.links()` - Returns a list of all links as strings


<details><summary> Aside: Wikipedia API content can be weird!</summary>

The wikipedia API often outputs content in unintuitive ways. For example, articles that are essentially just a big list become near useless, since the content omits the list (for example, see the wikipedia API content for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">List of countries and dependencies by population</a>). Another issue that you might encounter is that the API formats mathematical expressions in $\LaTeX$ pretty poorly (for example, see the wikipedia API content for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler divergence</a>). This is why it's important to determine what content the wikipedia API produces when `.content` is called â€” and why you want to make sure you're testing a large diversity of wikipedia articles.

</details>

<details><summary> Aside: Wikipedia "summaries" can be long!</summary>

The wikipedia API accesses summaries of pages by presenting all the information before the first titled section. For certain (generally obscure) wikipedia pages, this summary itself can be extremely long, and contain lots of information that is unnecessary to determine the key information about the page the model should be trying to access. We'll handle this later when it comes up by truncating wikipedia's summary to just the first ~1000 characters

</details>

Run the following code to see how these wikipedia API functions work!

```python
#Retrieve a Wikipedia page from its title
page = wikipedia.page("Large language model")

# Access basic page information
print("Title:", page.title)
print("\nURL", page.url)
print(f"\nSummary (word count {len( page.summary.split())}):", page.summary)
print(
    f"\nContent (word count {len( page.content.split())}):",
    page.content[:1000],
    "......",
)
print(
    f"""\nLinks (link count {len(page.links)}): [{", ".join(page.links[:7])}, ......]"""
)
```

Now run these two lines (you should see a `DisambiguationError` for the first, and a `PageError` for the second):

```python
page = wikipedia.page("Python")
```

```python
page = wikipedia.page("Animalss", auto_suggest=False)
```

We can handle these errors using the following code:

```python
# Fixes PageError by allowing redirects
page = wikipedia.page("Animalss", redirect=True)
print(page.title)

# Fixes DisambiguationError by selecting the first option

try:
    page = wikipedia.page("Python")
except DisambiguationError as e:
    page = wikipedia.page(e.options[0])
print(page.title)
```

- `DisambiguationError`: This was raised because the title "Python" can correspond to multiple pages. 
- `PageError`: This was raised for "Animalss" as there is no Wikipedia page with that title.

We have implemented a simple function `get_page()` for you to get the page object for a particular page title with error handling.

```python
def get_page(title: str) -> WikipediaPage:
    """
    Get a Wikipedia page object given a title. If the title is ambiguous, choose the first option. If the title is not found, try to find a similar title.

    Args:
        title (str): The title of the Wikipedia page

    Returns:
        WikipediaPage: The Wikipedia page
    """
    try:
        return wikipedia.page(title, auto_suggest=False, redirect=True)
    except DisambiguationError as e:
        return wikipedia.page(e.options[0], auto_suggest=False, redirect=True)
    except PageError as e:
        return wikipedia.page(title, auto_suggest=True, redirect=True)
```


<details><summary>What do kwargs <code>redirect</code> and <code>auto_suggest</code> in <code>wikipedia.page()</code> do?</summary>

`redirect`

- This kwarg enables redirecting when you reference an article title with **slight** differences to how it is stored in Wikipedia. For example, the Wikipedia API will generally access the correct page if there is a capitalization error on the first letter, but not for capitalization errors in the middle of the word if `redirect = False`:
```python
# This returns a WikipediaPage object for the "Human" page
page = wikipedia.page("huMan", redirect = True, auto_suggest=False)

# This raises a PageError since there is no page called "huMan"
page = wikipedia.page("huMan", redirect=False, auto_suggest=False)
```
- By default, we should set `redirect = True` in the `wikipedia.page()` function.

`auto_suggest`

- This kwarg enables the API to provide suggestions. This allows a lot more than `redirect` does, since `redirect` is only for the "obvious" cases (e.g. "huMan" â†’ "Human", "U.S. President" â†’ "President of the United States", etc.). When `auto_suggest` is true, it would allow something like "president of states" â†’ "President of the United States", "gogle" â†’ "Google"; both of which would raise an error if `redirect = True, auto_suggest = False`.
- However, `auto_suggest` can sometimes be *too* permissive and lead to errors. For example, the below code will return a `WikipediaPage` object for the "Man" page. This is clearly not what we were trying to access, and the `auto_suggest` has gotten carried away in this case:

```python
page = wikipedia.page("Human", redirect= False, auto_suggest=True)
```

- If `redirect = True` and `auto_suggest=True`, then `auto_suggest` takes priority. 
- **By default, we should set `auto_suggest` to `False` unless it is used as a last resort to resolve an error!**

### Exercise - Implement `get_permitted_links()`
```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª

You should spend up to ~10 mins on this exercise.
```
This is a quick exercise to familarize you with the Wikipedia API.

When you get the links from a page using `page.links`, this will include every possible Wikipedia link that is accessible from the HTML on that page, including those that are not in the main page content (e.g. links in sidebars, links in footnotes etc.), which are irrelevant or not permitted by the rules of the Wiki game. 

Write a simple `get_permitted_links()` function. This should only return the links that can be found inside the main content. The resulting list of permitted links should be about a third as long as the list of links from `page.links`. 

<!-- When writing this function, if you manage to get the links in a very effective way, then do that. But remember that Wikipedia is written by a large number of different contributors, often adhering to inconsistent stylings (especially for smaller articles). We just need to get something that **works well enough**. Put more time into doing this effectively if you want at the end, but as soon as something plausibly works, you should move on.

Build the `WikiGame` class that instantiates the wikipedia game. This should contain the following functionalities:
1. Keep track of task states
2. Give task-specifc instructions
3. Task-specific helper functions for calling the Wikipedia API. These less interesting methods have been provided for you, but you should read and understand what they do.


#### Providing information to the agent

While models are trained on most of the Wikipedia content, a particular page may still be confused with something else, or be an article that was added after the training cutoff. Models also can't always accurately recall information in their training data if they only come up once or twice. So you should use the game's `get_summary()` function to provide details of the goal page to the agent in its initial message.


```python
class WikiGame:
    def __init__(
        self,
        starting_page: str,

### Exercise - Build Tools for the WikiGame
```c
Difficulty: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšªâšªâšª
Importance: ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µâšªâšª

You should spend up to 15-20 mins on this exercise.
```

The basic WikiAgent will need these two tools at minimum to play the game:
1. `GetContentTool`: This returns the full content of the current page, with all the wiki-links wrapped in `<link></link>` tags (as otherwise they are presented as strings and indistinguishable from normal text). As implementing this involves annoying regex, we have done this for you, but you should fill in the `description()` property.
2. `MovePageTool`: This executes moving to a new given page when called and updates the `WikiGame` task state if successful. You should implement both the `execute()` function and the `description()` property.

When formatting this tool list, refer back to the solution for you wrote for the arithmetic game, or the OpenAI docs [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

<details><summary>Why not just use <code>WikipediaPage.links()</code> to get a list of links directly?</summary>

We don't just present a list of the accessible links, as this is not very faithful to the wikipedia game. The agent does perform somewhat better if we just give it a list of links, but the task of parsing the content of wikipedia pages and isolating the most important links is big part of the challenge of the wikipedia game.

</details>

<details><summary>Caveat for the <code>GetContentTool</code></summary>

The `GetContentTool` wraps all the texts that correspond to links in `<link></link>` tags. However, since we identify links in the text via their names on wikipedia pages, there are certain articles that will never (or only very rarely) get flagged as links. For example, the page "Python (programming language)" is almost never referenced by its title, instead its almost always referenced by just "Python"; the same is true for towns, which are usually referenced on Wikipedia as e.g. "Juneau, Alaska", but these are almost always referred to as just "Juneau". For this reason, you should avoid having goal pages which are not referenced by their title (or else implement a better version of the function, but beware of simply extracting the HTML source from pages, `wikipediaPage.html` can take a very long time to run, and HTML formatting varies significantly on Wikipedia).

### Exercise - Build a WikiAgent
```c
ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´âšª
ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ

You should spend up to 40-60 mins on this exercise.
```

We will now build a `WikiAgent` that can use these tools to solve the `WikiGame`. Build the agent so that it can be called via an agent loop, similar to the one we had for the arithmetic game. 

There are a few further considerations in this case that we didn't have for the arithmetic game. 

#### Context window constraint

Since Wikipedia articles could be very long, the length of the LLM's context window becomes a constraint. GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini both have context windows of 128k tokens (which corresponds to ~96k words). For reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which eventually adds up to be significant. 

We'll solve this for now by simply resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated set of instructions, so the agent can locate itself in the game. We'll address different methods for solving this issue later, you can probably already think of some. So be careful to include the current page and goal page for the agent in the instruction.

Since we'll reset the `chat_history` attribute of the agent class each time it reaches a new page, we'll also store a `full_chat_history` property that won't get reset, so we can access the entire run of the game.


#### Printing output

The `WikiGame` is a lot longer than the `ArithmeticTask`, with a much larger volume of agent, task and tool messages. If there's some chance you might not want to see this output, you should use the `verbose` parameter to set whether to print the output or not.

Similar to the `ArithmeticAgent`, write an agent loop for the `WikiAgent`.

```python

    """

    Args:

    """

    pass
```

<details><summary>Solution:</summary>

```python
def agent_loop(agent, game, num_loops=10):
    """
    Run the agent loop for a given number of loops

    Args:
        agent (WikiAgent): The agent to run

        num_loops (int): The number of loops to run
    """
    #agent.start()

    for i in range(num_loops):
        if game.check_win():
            print("Success!")
            return
        agent.run()
```
</details>

Your agent should be able to accomplish the following tasks:


```python
game_1 = WikiGame("Barack Obama", "India")
agent = WikiAgent(task=game_1, tools=wiki_game_tools)
agent_loop(agent, game_1, 30)
```

```python
game_2 = WikiGame("Albert Einstein", "Aristotle")
agent = WikiAgent(task=game_2, tools=wiki_game_tools)
agent_loop(agent, game_2, 30)
```


Once you've seen that the agent can accomplish the above, try out some different articles and see where the agent fails.

Check the messages in the chat history to see the full conversation between the agent and the user, to ensure that the messages that are printed above are faithful to the actual chat history (it can be easy to make minor mistakes that mess up the agent's chat_history).

```python
for message in agent.chat_history:
    try:
