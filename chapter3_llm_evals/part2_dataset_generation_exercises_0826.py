# # [3.2] Dataset Generation with Models

# %% [markdown]
# # Introduction

# %% [markdown]
# The goal of this section is to learn how to use LLMs to generate and refine an evaluation dataset. By the end, you will have generated a dataset of 300 questions, and have some confidence that a randomly chosen question from the dataset is high-quality. 
#  
# 
# The method used is from the [model-written evals paper](https://https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251) written by Ethan Perez et al. (2022). They explored procedures that use LMs to automate the bulk of generation and filtering, while redirecting human effort to instructing the LM (e.g. to write example questions and rubric), in order to greatly scale up the size of eval dataset that can be generated cheaply.

# ## Intro to API calls
# 
# We will make GPT generate questions using the OpenAI chat completion API, which allows us to programmatically send user messages and receive model responses. Read this [guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat-completions) on how to use the OpenAI API. 
# 
# In a chat context, instead of continuing a string of text, the model reads and continues a conversation consisting of a history of **messages**. Each message has a **role**, as well as its message content. LLMs is finetuned to interpret messages from the role `system` (fixed instructions that constrain the LLM responses, with the constraint being the task, context, and style/format of response) and `user` (a specific question/query to the LLM), and to respond in the role `assistant`. These messages are formated following [chat templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating) (a list of dictionaries). 
# 
# Standard code for API call looks like this:
# 
# <details>
# <summary>Help - Configure your OpenAI API key</summary>
# 
# You should go on https://platform.openai.com/ to create an account, then create a key in 'Dashboard'-> 'API keys'.
# A convenient set-up in VSCode is to have a `.env` file containing:
# 
# ```c
# OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-key"
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your-anth-key"
# ```
# 
# Then use the `load_dotenv` function from `dotenv` library, which will read in variables in `.env` files. Note that the names 'OPENAI_API_KEY' and 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' must be those exactly.
# 
# </details>

# %%
# Configure your API key
# Don't want to commit the key to the repo, so the machines
# that run this code need to have the key in an environment variable
# TODO: put your key in a .env file in the root directory of the project (or maybe we do this this?)
load_dotenv()
#api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
#openai.api_key = api_key

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",

    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},

# 
# LLM API imposes limits on the number of API calls a user can send within a period of time (e.g. tokens per minute, requests per day ...). See more info [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits). Therefore, when you use model API calls to generate a large dataset, you will most likely encounter a `RateLimitError`. 
# 
# The easiest way to fix this is to retry your request with a exponential backoff. Retry with exponential backoff means you perform a short sleep when a rate limit error occurs and try again. If the request is still unsuccessful, increase your sleep length and repeat this process until the request succeeds or a maximum number of retries is hit. 
# TODO: Add link to what a decorator function is and/or a short sentence or two
# You should fill in the decorator function `retry_with_exponential_backoff` below. This will be used to decorate our API call function. It should:
# * Try to implement `func` for `max_retries` number of times, then raise an exception if it's still unsuccessful
# * Perform a short sleep when `RateLimitError` is hit
# * Increment the sleep time by a `backoff_factor`, which varies by a small random jitter, each time a `RateLimitError` is hit. Your sleep time should increase exponentially with the number of rate limit errors, with `backoff_factor` as the exponential base.
# * Raise any non-rate-limit errors as normal

# ## Intro to prompt writing

# %% [markdown]
# Now, we can turn to writing prompts for the model. Prompting is one of the main tools we have to elicit and shape model behavior. Often when you see some kind of failure mode in the model's response, before you start thinking of a complicated solution, the first thing you might want to try is to see if you can modify the prompt to get rid of it.
# 
# Writing a good prompt is not unlike writing a good piece of text. You will develop a sense of what works and what doesn't as you go on, but here are some generally good tips for prompting:
# * **No typos, no repetitions, grammatically correct**
# * **Well structured into logically independent chunks and flow in an logical order**
# * **Be clear and concise.** Avoid very complex and long sentences, vague words.
# * **Be specific** about what you want the model to do. Give it the necessary context.
# * **Give it a role sometimes.** e.g. "You are an expert in writing evaluation tests for LLMs." helps emphasize token patterns associated with being an expert in writing evaluations.
# * **Add lines that steer it away from bad results** 
# 
# General notes:
# * **It's an iterative process**. You should be observing model responses and iteratively improving your prompts. When you have an idea, you should quickly test it - this feedback loop should be very fast.
# * **Don't overthink it**. Don't worry about getting it perfect - just make it good enough!
# 
# [Link to guide..]
# 
# The next 2 exercises are structured to make you iteratively improve a set of system and user prompts for question generation. You won't have time to make these as good as they can be. **The key takeaway is to see that prompts can really shape the model behavior by a lot.** Play around with prompts, delete sentences or add ones that you think would help, and see how the model respond.

# 
# We have provided you with a set of base prompts as a first-pass. The `system_prompt` tells the model that 'You are an expert at coming up with evaluations for large language models' and specifies the correct output format. The `user_prompt` gives instructions for power-seeking , which is the target behavior in this example. These do not elicit the optimal behavior, and you will write a second and third pass to improve on them.
# 
# * First pass: 
#     * system: "you are an expert" + description of the output format
#     * user: basic instruction + definition of the target behavior
# * Second pass:

# ## Intro to ThreadPoolExecutor
# 
# <details>
# <summary><b> Multithreading: The Broader Context </b></summary>
# 
# Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a program to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. This approach can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially those dealing with I/O-bound tasks or user interfaces.
# 
# Key concepts in multithreading include:
# * Concurrency: The ability to handle multiple tasks by switching between them rapidly.
# * Parallelism: True simultaneous execution of tasks (possible on multi-core processors).
# * Synchronization: Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent conflicts.
# * Thread safety: Ensuring code behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads.
# 
# </details>
# 
# **Introducing ThreadPoolExecutor**
# 
# For our purposes, we will only be using one part of the functionalities that multithreading offers - concurrent execution by ThreadPoolExecutor. ThreadPoolExecutor is part of Python's concurrent.futures module. It allows you to execute functions concurrently using a pool of "worker threads". This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, which are operations that spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations (like network/API requests or file operations) to complete. ThreadPoolExecutor significantly increases the speed and efficiency for these tasks by doing them in parallel.
# 
# Key Concepts:
# * Threads: Lightweight units of execution that can run concurrently within a process.
# * Worker: A thread in the pool that executes tasks.
# * max_workers: The maximum number of threads that can be active at once in the pool.
# 
# Let's start with the toy function `add_numbers` to understand how ThreadPoolExecutor works.

# %%
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """A simple function that adds two numbers and simulates some processing time."""
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate some work
    return a + b

# Using ThreadPoolExecutor
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor: # boilerplate code
    # Your code will go here
    pass

# %% [markdown]
# Below are the main functions from ThreadPoolExecutor. Read the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) on concurrent.futures.Executor to understand the syntax for how to use them. We will summarize the key differences and use cases here. 
# 
# * `map()` - execute a function many times (on different input) concurrently
#     * Like the `map()` function in python, applies the same function to an iterable of input args, but starts all runs concurrently (and immediately)
#     * Returns an iterator of the results directly
# * `submit()` - schedules a function to be executed asychronously
#     * Does not necessarily start the run of the function immediately
#     * Returns a Future object to represent the execution of the function. The Future object allows the running function to be queried, cancelled, and for the results to be retrieved later, and gives you more fine-grained manipulation (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#future-objects) for ways to manipulate Future objects)
# 
# Use cases:
# * `map()`
#     1. When you have a homogenous set of tasks (same function, different arguments)
#     2. When you want to process results in the order of the input
#     3. Often simpler and more straightfoward if you just want the results and don't need special control over them
# * `submit()` 
#     1. When you want fine-grained control over individual tasks and manipulate each future
#     2. When the tasks are heterogenous (different functions, different numbers of arguments)
# 
# 
# Run the following code using `map()` to see how it works in action:

# %%
# When you have a homogeneous set of tasks (same function, different arguments):

numbers_to_add = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)] # Iterable of tuple input

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results = executor.map(lambda x: add_numbers(*x), numbers_to_add) # Returns an iterator of results
    for nums, result in zip(numbers_to_add, results):
        print(f"Sums of {nums}: {result}") 


# Get results in the order of the input:

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    squares = list(executor.map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))
    print(f"Squares from 1 to 10 are: {squares}") # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# %% [markdown]
# Now run the following code on `submit()` to see how it works:

# %%
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    # Submit a single task 
    future = executor.submit(add_numbers, 15, 62) # returns a Future object
    result = future.result()
    print(f"15 + 62 = {result}") # use `.result()` to access the result

    # Submit multiple tasks
    futures = [executor.submit(add_numbers, i, i) for i in range(10)] # submit a list of 10 tasks and returns a list of Future objects

    # Get results dynamically as they are completed using as_complete() function
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result() # Notice that this is not in the order of the input, unlike `executor.map()`
        print(f"{int(result/2)} + {int(result/2)} = {result}")


# %% [markdown]
# To see how ThreadPoolExecutor is faster than serial execution:

# %%

# * Prompting
