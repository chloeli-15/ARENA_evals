    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll learn how to use the Inspect library to run the evals you generated in [3.2] on current language models. At the end, you should have results giving evidence towards whether these models have the property you set out to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will first need to familiarise ourselves with Inspect, which will be the majority of this chapter. This is a library we'll use to make running our evaluations easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've done that we'll obtain **baselines** across different models. Baselines measure whether the model can understand all of your questions. For example, a model may not be capable enough to decide which answer is \"power-seeking\" even if it wanted to be power-seeking. Baselines will therefore give us the upper- and lower-bounds of the results we should expect to receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will run our evaluation. Using Inspect, we'll be able to do a lot more than simply present the question and generate an answer. We'll be able to: vary whether the model uses chain-of-thought reasoning to come to a conclusion, vary whether the model critiques its own answer, vary whether a system prompt is provided to the model or not, and more. This will enable us to get collect more data, and to determine how model behavior changes in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises continue from chapter [3.2]. If you didn't manage to generate 300 questions, we've prepared 300 example model-generated questions for the **tendency to seek power** following on from chapter [3.1] and chapter [3.2]. Similarly to previous days, the solutions are written with tendency to seek power in mind. However, it shouldn't be too hard to change any texts or function names to align with the dataset you've created."

Self-critique is most useful when we're asking the model for a capability, but if your dataset contains more complex questions, self-critique might get the model to reach a different conclusion (there is a difference on the power-seeking example dataset between CoT + self-critique, and CoT alone).\n",

    "- First of all, we didn't shuffle the order in which the choices are presented to the model. Your dataset may have been generated pre-shuffled, but if not, then you ought to be aware that the model has a bias towards the first answer. See for example [Narayanan & Kapoor: Does ChatGPT have a Liberal Bias?](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/does-chatgpt-have-a-liberal-bias) To mitigate this confounder, we should shuffle the choices (and answer) around when loading in the dataset.\n",

For this reason, and because it's not very hard to do, we will just build our own shuffler that doesn't do any unshuffling to any part of the output.</details>\n",

    "- Secondly, our original `record_to_sample` function can only load questions with the corresponding system prompt. It is often useful to load the dataset without a system prompt. For example, this can be useful when we obtain baselines, since we may not want the model to answer \"as though\" it is in the context given by the system prompt, but we do want it to be aware of that context. We also may want to load without a system prompt when running an evaluation, so we can see how the model reacts to our questions when presented with a more generic \"You are a harmless, helpful, honest AI Chat Assistant\" system prompt (which we can then provide with our `system_message` solver).
