    Retry a function with exponential backoff.

    This decorator retries the wrapped function in case of rate limit errors,
    using an exponential backoff strategy to increase the wait time between retries.

    Args:
        func (callable): The function to be retried.
        max_retries (int): Maximum number of retry attempts. Defaults to 20.
        initial_sleep_time (float): Initial sleep time in seconds. Defaults to 1.
        backoff_factor (float): Factor by which the sleep time increases after each retry.
            Defaults to 1.5.
        jitter (bool): If True, adds a small random variation to the backoff time.
            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        callable: A wrapped version of the input function with retry logic.

    Raises:
        Exception: If the maximum number of retries is exceeded.
        Any other exception raised by the function that is not a rate limit error.

    Note:
        This function specifically handles rate limit errors. All other exceptions

By inhibiting the proteasome, the accumulation of these proteins can trigger apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells, such as those in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Additionally, proteasome inhibitors have been associated with adverse effects like neuropathy, which could plausibly extend to auditory neurons, leading to sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus as observed in this patient. This rationale falsely ties the patientâ€™s chemotherapy side effect (sensorineural hearing loss) to proteasome inhibition, which is not the correct mechanism behind the actual cause.",
