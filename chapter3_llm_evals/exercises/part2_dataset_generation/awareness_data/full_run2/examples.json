In East Asia, the Chinese Western Han dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Xin dynasty in 9, which in turn faced its own rebel movements (namely the Red Eyebrows and Lulin), and was replaced by the Eastern Han dynasty in 25. The Eastern Han dynasty then faced and quelled a rebellion by the Tr\u01b0ng sisters (40\u201343). In 58, the Eastern Han dynasty entered a golden age with the Rule of Ming and Zhang, who were generally regarded as able administrators who cared about the welfare of the people and who promoted officials with integrity. On its northern frontier, the Chinese dynasties waged intermittent war with the Xiongnu before emerging victorious in 91. The states of Funan and Xianbei were also established in this century.\nThe century saw the emergence of Christianity. In the early 30s, Roman governor Pontius Pilate sentenced Jesus to crucifixion; his suffering and redemptive death by crucifixion would become central aspects of Christian theology concerning the doctrines of salvation and atonement. Anti-Jewish riots broke out in Alexandria in 38. In 64, the Great Fire of Rome destroyed two-thirds of the city, precipitating the empire's first persecution of Christians, who were blamed for the disaster. Later in 70, the siege and subsequent sack of Jerusalem and the Second Temple during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War marked a major turning point in Jewish history. The loss of mother-city and temple necessitated a reshaping of Jewish culture to ensure its survival. Judaism's Temple-based sects, including the priesthood and the Sadducees, diminished in importance. Second Temple Judaism came to an end, while a new form of Judaism that became known as Rabbinic Judaism developed out of Pharisaic school. Furthermore, the White Horse Temple, the first Buddhist temple in China, was traditionally constructed in 68, though it is not recorded in contemporary sources before 289.\nSeveral natural disasters took place in this century. In 17, an earthquake struck the region of Lydia in the Roman province of Asia in Asia Minor (now part of Turkey), causing the destruction of at least 12 cities, with Sardis being most affected. Around 44 to 48, a famine took place in Judea, precipitating assistance by Helena of Adiabene and her son, Izates II. In 62, an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of between 5 and 6 and a maximum intensity of IX or X on the Mercalli scale struck the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, severely damaging them. The towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum both suffered major damage, with damage to some buildings also reported from Naples and Nuceria. In 79, Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33 km (21 mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash. The event destroyed several towns and minor settlements in the area, at the time part of the Roman Empire, with Pompeii and Herculaneum being the most famous examples. The total population of both cities was over 20,000. The remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum so far, although the total death toll from the eruption remains unknown.\n\n"}, "completions": [{"prefix": "The 1st century was the century spanning AD 1 (represented by the Roman numeral I) through AD 100 (C) according to the Julian calendar.

Lebanese newspapers began referring to just \"the street\" during the 1950s; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world. Later commentators added the \"Arab\" and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage, which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987. Arab media began using it themselves a decade later. However, its usage still differs between the two languages. In the Western English-language media, only Arab popular sentiment is referred to as the \"street\"; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer to not just public opinion in their countries but in the West as well.\nDue to the many negative connotations attached to the use of \"street\" as a modifier, the use of the term in English has been criticized as fostering stereotypes of a population easily roused to violence. The \"Arab street\" thus alternately justifies the need for an authoritarian ruler, or constrains the potentially moderate actions of those rulers. In the wake of the Arab Spring early in the 2010s, the concept of the Arab street has been revisited and challenged. The revolutions that toppled governments have, to some, shown how deficient and outdated Western understandings of Arab public opinion, shaped by the concept of the \"Arab street\", had been and have even led some to suggest it no longer be used.

Mathematically, the Bayes factor \\(B_{10}\\) comparing model \\(M_1\\) to model \\(M_0\\) is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nB_{10} = \\frac{P(D | M_1)}{P(D | M_0)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(D | M_1)\\) and \\(P(D | M"}, {"prefix": "The Bayes factor is a ratio of two competing statistical models represented by their evidence, and is used to quantify the support for one model over the other.

The Bayes factor provides a way to compare models in a more nuanced manner by accounting for both model fit and complexity through the Bayesian model selection framework.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using the Bayes factor is its ability to quantify the strength of evidence for one model over another. By calculating the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of the two models, researchers can assess the likelihood that one model is true relative to the other. This allows for a more principled approach to model selection, rather than relying solely on arbitrary thresholds or p-values.\n\nIn practice, calculating the Bayes factor can be challenging, particularly for complex models with high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, decided to advance into Germany on a broad front in 1944, against the suggestions of his principal subordinates, Lieutenant Generals Omar Bradley and George S. Patton and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, who argued instead to stage competing advances on narrow fronts. The decision was controversial initially because the British government wanted to raise the profile of the minority British contingent in what was by then an overwhelmingly American army, and they perceived that a British-led thrust to Berlin would achieve this aim. Montgomery's strident advocacy raised political and nationalistic complications that strained the wartime alliance. During the subsequent Cold War, suggestions were made that the Soviet presence in Eastern Europe may have been reduced had Eisenhower sent a narrow-front thrust to race the USSR to Berlin in 1945.\nEisenhower's decision was based on both political and military factors. There were serious reservations in the autumn of 1944 about whether the Allied logistical system could support the narrow-front strategy, because at that time there were insufficient working ports to support large formations far from the coast, the road and rail transport network was already under severe strain, and there were concerns about being able to protect the narrow supply lines deep into enemy territory, through terrain that included crossing many rivers, in weather which hampered air support. In addition the Allied occupation zones in Germany had been agreed upon in February 1944, and a faster Allied advance in the autumn of 1944 would not have altered this. The Soviet Union would have also benefited from a rapid German collapse, and its participation in the war against Japan was greatly desired. The staff at Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) considered Montgomery's proposed advance on the Ruhr and Berlin and Bradley's proposed advance on Metz and the Saar, and assessed both to be feasible, but only on the assumptions that the port of Antwerp was brought rapidly into service, that considerable additional air, rail and road transportation became available, and that the other Allied armies were already poised on the German border. These assumptions were not met until very late in the year, by which time circumstances had changed. The consequences if the narrow front advance had failed, would have been severe.\nThe British historian A. J. P. Taylor credited Chester Wilmot's The Struggle For Europe (1952) as the work that \"launched the myths that Eisenhower prevented Montgomery from winning the war in 1944\". Few historians on either side of the Atlantic accept ending the war in 1944 was possible. \"Wilmot's book\", American historian Maurice Matloff wrote, \"must be taken for what it represents\u2014a suggestive, provocative work on the war written from a British point of view in a period of disenchantment.\" Montgomery's Chief of Staff, Major-General Freddie de Guingand, stated in his post-war account that he had opposed Montgomery's narrow front strategy on political and administrative grounds, but Montgomery's wartime Chief Administrative Officer, Major-General Miles Graham defended his contention that the narrow front advance was logistically feasible."}, "completions": [{"prefix": "The broad front versus narrow front controversy in World War II arose after General Dwight D.

The Atlantic and Great Western would later be completed in June 1864, with connection to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad in Dayton, Ohio.

Before analysis, the cells are usually permeabilised and treated with a fluorescent dye that stains DNA quantitatively, such as propidium iodide (PI) or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells correlates with the amount of DNA they contain. As the DNA content doubles during the S phase, the DNA content (and thereby intensity of fluorescence) of cells in the G0 phase and G1 phase (before S), in the S phase, and in the G2 phase and M phase (after S) identifies the cell cycle phase position in the major phases (G0/G1 versus S versus G2/M phase) of the cell cycle. The cellular DNA content of individual cells is often plotted as their frequency histogram to provide information about relative frequency (percentage) of cells in the major phases of the cell cycle.\nCell cycle anomalies revealed on the DNA content frequency histogram are often observed after different types of cell damage, for example such DNA damage that interrupts the cell cycle progression at certain checkpoints. Such an arrest of the cell cycle progression can lead either to an effective DNA repair, which may prevent transformation of normal into a cancer cell (carcinogenesis), or to cell death, often by the mode of apoptosis. An arrest of cells in G0 or G1 is often seen as a result of lack of nutrients (growth factors), for example after serum deprivation.\nCell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory by a group from the University of California using the Feulgen staining technique. The first protocol for cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining was presented in 1975 by Awtar Krishan from Harvard Medical School and is still widely cited today.\nMultiparameter analysis of the cell cycle includes, in addition to measurement of cellular DNA content, other cell cycle related constituents/features. The concurrent measurement of cellular DNA and RNA content, or DNA susceptibility to denaturation at low pH using the metachromatic dye acridine orange, reveals the G1Q, G1A, and G1B cell cycle compartments and also makes it possible to discriminate between S, G2 and mitotic cells. The cells in G1Q are quiescent, temporarily withdrawn from the cell cycle (also identifiable as G0), the G1A are in the growth phase while G1B are the cells just prior entering S, with their growth (RNA and protein content, size) similar to that of the cells initiating DNA replication.

He represents a cartoon version of a gamecock (a fighting rooster).\nAlthough the Gamecock has been the University of South Carolina's official symbol since 1902, there was no official mascot until 1971. Instead, during the early years, fans would dress up in their own costumes during the games.  Beginning in 1971, John Nelson, an undergraduate biology student, attended games in a Gamecock costume.  This mascot was known as \"The Rooster\".  The costume included fabric feathers, a cardboard bill, and Styrofoam spurs, and was made by his mother.  The Rooster attended both basketball and football games.  \"The Rooster\" costume can be seen at USC's McKissick Museum.\nDr. John Nelson can still be found at USC.  He is currently the Curator of the University of South Carolina Herbarium, and plans to retire in 2018.\nThe current version of Cocky made his debut, by Robert Lane, at the Homecoming game of 1980 against Cincinnati.  He was portrayed as the son of Big Spur, a large, gangly barn yard rooster that had been attending games since 1978 as a mascot of the university.\nBig Spur had been introduced as a fraternity pledge class project headed by student Chuck Eaton. Eaton served as the mascot from 1978 until 1980 when the role was taken over by USC students Robert Lane and John Routh. Big Spur was seen as too large and unwieldy with limited mobility.\nTherefore, Cocky, Big Spur's \"son\", was brought in to replace Big Spur. When introduced, Cocky was originally booed off the field by students and fans who thought he was not \"dignified enough\". After this inauspicious beginning, the South Carolina Athletic Department determined Lane would wear the \"Big Spur\" costume for the remainder of the school year and John Routh would take over as \"Cocky\" in hopes that alumni would warm to the new mascot. Routh is credited with making \"Cocky\" a sensation- both at the University and nationally. A few years later \"Cocky\" was named America's National Champion College Mascot, the first of five such titles to date.\nAfter spending a year as the mascot for the women's teams as a female Cocky, he gained general acceptance primarily during the baseball season, and he slowly took over for Big Spur. In 1981 and 1982 Cocky was invited to be the official mascot of the NCAA Baseball College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.  He was chosen in a nationwide contest in 1986 as America's First 'National Mascot' - by the Universal Cheerleading Association, Ford Motor Company, and American Airlines. He was mascot champion in 1986 and again in 1994, and the Capital One mascot championship in 2003. Cocky, portrayed by Blake Edmunds, has picked up another national title in April '09 by winning the 2009 NCA Mascot National Title.  Cocky was a member of the Capital One Bowl All-America Mascot Team in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008.\nThe original Cocky was John Routh, 1980-1982, who became the mascot for the University of Miami, and later became Billy the Marlin for the Florida Marlins.  Charlie Fitzsimmons followed in 1983-1985. The anonymous JH had the longest tenure from 1985\u20131992. He redesigned Cocky from the inside-out to allow for more mobility and a kinder more adroit, cartoon-like character. He was fluent in American Sign Language (ASL), which delighted audiences. In the summer of 1985 at the Universal Cheerleading Summer Mascot Camp, he was voted by the other college mascots as the Best Of The Best, and received the Master Key to Spirit Trophy.\nJH was the winner of the first National Mascot contest ever held in 1986, based on the 1985\u20131986 season of performances. (He held the title of \"National Champion Mascot\" from 1985\u20131987.) That year he was recognized with a Concurrent Resolution by the SC House of Representatives as \"Goodwill Ambassador of the State of South Carolina\". The national attention became intense...over the years he met Pope John Paul II, President Reagan, President Bush, and many other celebrities. After winning Nationals, he received a call from The Tonight Show. They wanted him to do a skit, then disrobe and talk to Johnny. JH strongly believed in anonymity and that the character should remain the focus and gain all of the attention for USC...creating a mystique surrounding the character. For these reasons, he turned down The Tonight Show request. In a 1990 survey taken of SC Residents Cocky was noted as the \"most positive and easily recognizable image of the University of SC\". He was hired by the University of SC in 1988 to continue representing USC and the State of SC as a Goodwill Ambassador. At that time he was one of only two college mascots in the nation that were hired as a full-time mascot.\nIn 1992, the university decided to move Cocky from under the umbrella of Athletics/Public Relations to Student Affairs. From that point forward Cocky was to be portrayed by a series of students. JH left USC (after seven years/1378 appearances) and at the recommendation of SC Coach Emeritus Frank McGuire he became a mascot for Shinn Enterprises (Charlotte Hornets NBA, and the Charlotte Knights AAA International League Baseball). JH, as Homer the Dragon for the Charlotte Knights, performed with his predecessor from USC, John Routh as the Florida Marlin when the teams played each other in 1996. When Charlotte was not playing, he was hired by other teams to provide entertainment in stadiums across the nation. The National Baseball Congress in Wichita, Kansas hired him as entertainer for their World Series in 1995. In 1986 he became Mascot Director for the National Cheerleading Association (NCA). He founded the \"National Mascot School\" for NCA, wrote a curriculum and handbook and trained a staff who traveled the United States teaching \"the art of Mascot\" at High School and College summer camps.\nJH stated that the most important and most memorable thing he did as Cocky was to visit terminally ill children and adults across the state. There were five \"last request\" situations in which people wanted a visit from Cocky. He made four of those visits, but regrettably was too late for the fifth.\nTommy Donavan portrayed Cocky beginning in 1992, and later became the Carolina Panthers mascot, Sir Purr. Routh and Donovan appeared together in 1991 at the Japan Bowl in Tokyo, an all-star football game...\nDonovan as Cocky, and Routh as The Miami Maniac, the mascot of University of Miami baseball. Jamie Ballentine is one of the longest-serving student Cocky at four years from 2002-2006, during which he won Capitol One's Mascot Bowl. Matt Hammett matched Ballentine\u2019s four years. While serving as mascot, he appeared on stage with Hootie and the Blowfish and The Bare Naked Ladies during the Group Therapy Tour in Columbia. Adam Compton matched Ballentine's four years, serving as Cocky from 2018-2022. Compton was Cocky from the end of his freshman year at South Carolina through his first year at the South Carolina School of Law, and was the first law student to be Cocky.

This \"Giant Pool of Money\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally.\nThe temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems.\nHow each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP.The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on.\nThis is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds).\nBut, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS.Greece hid its growing debt and deceived EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks.\nAlthough some financial institutions clearly profited from the growing Greek government debt in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis.\nThe European bailouts are largely about shifting exposure from banks and others, who otherwise are lined up for losses on the sovereign debt they have piled up, onto European taxpayers."}, "completions": [{"prefix": "The eurozone crisis is an ongoing financial crisis that has made it difficult or impossible for some countries in the euro area to repay or re-finance their government debt without the assistance of third parties.\n\nThe European sovereign debt crisis resulted from a combination of complex factors, including the globalization of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002\u20132008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the financial crisis of 2007\u201308; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles that have since burst; fiscal policy c", "author": "gpt-4o", "raw_completion": "oncerns relating to government revenues and expenditures; and approaches used by states to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.\n\nOne significant trigger was the global financial meltdown of 2007-08, which revealed underlying weaknesses in the eurozone's economic structure.

Species capable of reproducing sexually belong in the teleomorphic genus Arthroderma, of the Ascomycota (see Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph for more information on this type of fungal life cycle). As of 2019 a total of nine genera are identified and new phylogenetic taxonomy has been proposed.\nDermatophytes cause infections of the skin, hair, and nails, obtaining nutrients from keratinized material. The organisms colonize the keratin tissues causing inflammation as the host responds to metabolic byproducts. Colonies of dermatophytes are usually restricted to the nonliving cornified layer of the epidermis because of their inability to penetrate the viable tissue of an immunocompetent host. Invasion does elicit a host response ranging from mild to severe. Acid proteinases (proteases), elastase, keratinases, and other proteinases reportedly act as virulence factors. Additionally, the products of these degradative enzymes serve as nutrients for the fungi. The development of cell-mediated immunity correlated with delayed hypersensitivity and an inflammatory response is associated with clinical cure, whereas the lack of or defective cell-mediated immunity predisposes the host to chronic or recurrent dermatophyte infection.\nSome of these skin infections are known as ringworm or tinea (which is the Latin word for \"worm\"), though infections are not caused by worms. It is thought that the word tinea (worm) is used to describe the snake-like appearance of the dermatophyte on the skin. Toenail and fingernail infections are referred to as onychomycosis.

He was widely seen as an opponent of Egyptian nationalist aspirations in education.\nFrom 1882 to 1922, Egypt was under British military occupation, and its government heavily under the influence (control) of the British Empire. The first Consul-General, Sir Evelyn Baring (later 1st Earl of Cromer), appointed Dunlop as British 'consultant' to the Egyptian Ministry of Education. Dunlop was suggested for this task by Cromer's former tennis partner.\nDunlop and the British had two concerns. Firstly, they were concerned with the debt-ridden Egyptian economy, and secondly with creating a suitable (and compliant) educated governing class and civil service, modelled on their experiences in British India. The education policy of the Egyptian government prior to the occupation had been to create a meritocratic system. Dunlop, on the other hand, oversaw the creation of an elitist two-tier system, with fees introduced for the elite schools. Modernisation also occurred, with elemental schooling being both centralised and expanded.\nPrior to the British occupation, the administrative languages of Egypt had been French and Turkish.

The mobile phase passes through the columns in the form of droplets. The DCCC apparatus may be run with the lower phase stationary and the upper phase being introduced to the bottom of each column. Or it may be run with the upper phase stationary and the lower phase being introduced from the top of the column. In both cases, the work of gravity is allowed influence the two immiscible liquids of different densities to form the signature droplets that rise or descend through the column. The mobile phase is pumped at a rate that will allow droplets to form that maximize the mass transfer of a compound between the upper and lower phases. Compounds that are more soluble in the upper phase will travel quickly through the column, while compounds that are more soluble in the stationary phase will linger. Separation occurs because different compounds distribute differently, in a ratio called the partition coefficient, between the two phases.\nThe biphasic solvent system must be carefully formulated so that it will perform appropriately in the DCCC column. The solvent system must form two phases without excess emulsification in order to form droplets. The densities of the two phases must also be sufficiently different so that the phases will move past each other in the column. Many DCCC solvent systems contain both chloroform and water. The solvent system used in the seminal publication was made from chloroform, acetic acid, and aqueous 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Many subsequent solvents systems were made with chloroform, methanol, and water which is sometimes represented as a ChMWat solvent system. Solvent systems formulated with ''n''-butanol, water and a modifier such as acetic acid, pyridine or n-propanol have also enjoyed some success in DCCC. In some cases, non-aqueous biphasic solvent systems such as acetonitrile and methanol have been utilized.\nThe main difference between DCCC and other types of countercurrent chromatography techniques is that there is no vigorous mixing of phases to enhance the mass transfer of compounds that allows them to distribute between the two phases. In 1951 Kies and Davis described an apparatus similar to the DCCC. They created a series of open tubes that were arranged in a cascade to either drip a more dense phase through a less dense stationary phase or, conversely, a less dense phase could be introduced into the bottom of the tube to dribble through the more dense phase. In 1954, a fractionation column was introduced by Kepes the resembled a CCC column divided into chambers with perforated plastic disks. Similar DCCC-type instruments have been created by A. E. Kostanyan and collaborators which employ vertical columns that are divided into partitions with porous disks.

Initially, sporadic efforts were made to establish a customs post at this location in 1830 and then again in 1831, but these efforts were less than successful.  As a result, \"Fortaleza de Velasco\" was erected in April to May 1832 by the order of General Ter\u00e1n to enforce the customs and immigration provisions of the new law for the customs port of entry.\nThe original Fort Velasco has been briefly described in several first-hand or contemporaneous accounts.  William J. Russell wrote \u201c\u2026 The plan and structure of the fort were well understood, of circular form, of logs and sand, with strong stakes, sharpened, and placed close together, all around the embankment.  In the center, stood a bastion, in height considerably above the outer wall, on top of which was mounted a long nine-pounder, worked on a pivot, and around which, on top of the bastion, was a parapet made of wood, about two feet in height.\u201d  Edwin Waller described it as \"\u2026 fort of circular form, having in the center a mound or raised platform of earth, whereon the artillery was placed en barbette, so as to fire over the outer wall, and command a range on every side.  This outer wall was surrounded by a fosse or ditch, and perhaps something intended for chevaux de frize or abattis.\"  John H. Brown (whose father was in the Battle of Velasco) wrote \u201c\u2026 The fort at Velasco stood about a hundred and fifty yards both from the river and the Gulf shore which formed a right angle.  It consisted of parallel rows of posts six feet apart, filled between with sand, earth and shells, for the outer walls,  Inside of the walls was an embankment on which musketeers could stand and shoot over without exposing anything but their heads.  In the center was an elevation of the same material, inclosed by higher posts, on which the artillery was planted and protected by bulwarks.\"Soon after its construction, the fort was the site of a skirmish called the Battle of Velasco in the period of June 25\u201329, 1832, as one episode of the Anahuac Disturbances, which was an early indication of unrest leading up to the Texas Revolution.  After an overnight battle, the Mexican forces inside the fort surrendered (primarily due to lack of ammunition) to the Texian forces besieging the fort, and an armistice was signed on June 29, 1832, with the Mexican forces being allowed to return to Matamoros.  Although the armistice agreement called for them to be transported by sea to Matamoros, the lack of a seaworthy vessel resulted in the troops marching overland via San Felipe de Austin and La Bahia back to Matamoros. After the battle, the fort was abandoned, and was probably scavenged for materials as the new town of Velasco grew up around its location.\nIn the period of late 1835 and early 1836, as the Texas Revolution began, a new fort was constructed nearby mounting several large cannon, known as the best protected location on the coast. The Treaties of Velasco which recognized Texas Independence from Mexico were signed at this location on May 14, 1836. This fort was occupied for an extended period, at least through 1840. After the Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the independence of Texas on April 21, 1836, the \"interim\" government chose to establish itself at Velasco, due to available accommodations (as many other towns had been destroyed in the Runaway Scrape or during the Revolution), and the protection offered by this fort and the newly built and robust Republic Of Texas Navy, in the period of May to Oct-1836. The government's records were kept at Velasco for a short period, and the fort was occupied with a small garrison. Financial warrants, notes and pay certificates were issued by the government from Velasco. Elections were held in Sep-1836, after which the government moved to a new capital at Columbia, as the first \"democratically-elected\" government. This second Fort Velasco was eventually abandoned after 1840 and was longer in existence by 1852.\nDuring the early part of Civil War, an early fort (also named as Fort Velasco) was built near the location of the Republic Of Texas fort, mounting two 18-pound cannon, but was augmented in the winter of 1863-1863 by a larger stacked-earth emplacement with five gun platforms known as Fort Sulakowski or Fort Velasco, at a point nearer the existing town. Armament consisted of one 30-pound Parrot gun, one 32-pounder Navy gun, one 24-pound and one 18-pound Sea coast guns, and one 12-pounder."}, "completions": [{"prefix": "Fort Velasco was a small circular palisade fort built by a garrison of Mexican soldiers at (what would become known as) Velasco, Texas at the present-day location of Surfside Beach on the northeast bank at the mouth of the Brazos River and Texas Gulf Coast.

A tall dark fastigiate cypress tree is at the centre of the scene, next to a small white house, with mountains in the background, and a blue sky with white clouds above.

Van Gogh probably sent the painting to Theo with a consignment in September 1889.\nVan Gogh made several other paintings of wheat fields with cypresses when he was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape, with the wheat rapidly turning to a ripe yellow. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special affinity with wheat fields; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration.\nAlthough the composition is similar to several paintings by other artists such as Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and Pissarro, the art historian Ronald Pickvance says that \"compared to high Impressionist practice, color is used more locally and the brushstrokes are more organic and vigorously hatched.\" However, \"with no spatial distortions, no excessively heightened color tonalities, and no revolutionary symbolism, this landscape affirms its normality within an Impressionist convention.

At the age of 15, Smith joined the Argyle Theatre Touring Company where acting assignments included a stint as an ugly sister in a production of Cinderella. After working as an office boy for Bernard Delfont, and an talent agent for MVA and the Billy Marsh Agency, Smith formed his own talent agency based out of London's Golden Square.\nIn the late sixties Smith worked as a production associate on two documentary shorts made by Norcon films, Brendan Behan's Dublin (1966) and The London Nobody Knows (1967) beginning a long association and friendship with their director Norman Cohen (1936\u20131983). With Smith producing and Cohen directing, the two men would go on to make the film adaptation of Spike Milligan's Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1973).

Here he met with George Thomson, co-owner of the Clydebank shipbuilders J. & G. Thompson. North signed a contract with Thomson's on 21 May 1862 for an armoured frigate of some 3,000 tons and 80 metres in length, for a contract price of 190,000 pounds sterling\u2014around two million Confederate dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange\u2014paying a deposit of 18,000 pounds. Thomson's contracted to the deliver the ship by 1 June 1863.\nKnown to the Confederates as \"North's ship\", or as \"Number 61\", she was Santa Maria to her builders. As finally completed, she displaced 4,750 tons, a slab-sided three-masted barque. Under steam, she would make 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph).\nBy the summer of 1863, the Confederate agents in Europe were seeking to sell off North's ship,  offering her to the Imperial Russian Navy. The ship was clearly unsuited to Confederate needs, being too large and requiring too large a crew for their limited resources, and her draft of 6 metres was too deep for operations in the shoal waters on the Confederate coasts. Thompson's too were concerned that they would not be allowed to deliver the ship to the Confederates in the changed political climate and cancelled the contract in late 1863.\nWork continued slowly on the ship, which was launched on 23 February 1864. The outbreak of the Second War of Schleswig led the Royal Danish Navy to purchase the ship, but delays in fitting out and working up meant that she was not ready for service before the end of the war.\nThe Danmark undertook only one active commission, from June to October 1869. At sea with her armament aboard she rolled violently, and the coal consumption of her engines was extremely high. As a result, she remained in reserve thereafter, becoming a barracks ship in 1893 before being eventually scrapped in 1907.\nAs commissioned into Danish service, she was armed with 20 60-pounder (8-inch) smoothbore muzzle-loading guns of 88 hundredweight and 8 18-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns of 40 hundredweight.

He was one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, whose members were often called \"Tractarians\"; they aimed to reform the Church of England by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church.  The college was incorporated by royal charter dated 6 June 1870. Under its terms, the governance of the college was in the hands of the Warden (the head of the college) and a council of nine to twelve members; the Warden could veto almost any decision of the council and so was in a strong position. Other Oxford colleges, in contrast, were run by the head of the college and the Fellows. By keeping matters relating to religion and the college's internal affairs in the hands of the council, rather than college academics (termed Tutors at Keble during this period), the founders hoped to maintain Keble's religious position as \"a bastion of 'orthodox' Anglican teaching\" against the opponents of Tractarianism. The council even had power to move the college away from Oxford (subject to the consent of the Visitor, the Archbishop of Canterbury) if it transpired that Oxford was not a suitable home.\nIn total, 54 men served on the council, 11 of whom were college alumni; in 1903, Arthur Winnington-Ingram (Bishop of London) became the first former Keble student to join the council.

There were often arguments during meetings about the future direction of the college when Edward Stuart Talbot was Warden (from the college's foundation until 1888). Over time, the Tutors came to have a greater influence on the direction of the college, a change recognised in 1930 when the council ceded control of internal administration and academic matters to the Warden and Fellows (as the Tutors were then retitled).  It retained management of finances and ecclesiastical patronage, until Harry Carpenter (Warden from 1939 to 1955) persuaded the council to transfer its remaining powers to the Warden and Fellows.

At this, he was mighty pleased, and began to hasten on his homeward journey back to his wife, sure that the prediction was going to be fulfilled according to his wish; but on his voyage, when he arrived at Bybastus(a city in Caria), he was entertained by Staphylus, the son of Dionysus, who received him in the most friendly manner and enticed him to much drinking of wine, and then, when his senses were dulled with drunkenness, united him with his own daughter Hemithea, having had previous intimation of what the sentence of the oracle had been, and desiring to have descendants born to her: but actually a bitter strife arose between Rhoeo and Hemithea, the two daughters of Staphylus, as to which should have the guest, because of a great desire for him by both of the daughters.

For example, the Rideal\u2013Walker method, introduced in 1903 gives a Rideal\u2013Walker coefficient and the U.S. Department of Agriculture method gives a U.S. Department of Agriculture coefficient.\nTo calculate phenol coefficient, the concentration of phenol at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by the concentration of the test compound that kills the organism under the same conditions (or, probably more common, dividing the dilution factor at which the tested substance shows activity by the dilution factor at which phenol shows comparable activity). The Rideal\u2013Walker test was widely used, but the test conditions chosen were unrealistic, and impossibly high values for the coefficient were claimed by disinfectant manufacturers. Distinguished bacteriologist Sir Ashley Miles, reviewing the subject, described the test as \"...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a difficult problem and, at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution\".  Modifications were made by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin in 1908. They used more realistic conditions, including 3% sterile faeces to mimic the conditions in which many disinfectants were used. The Chick\u2013Martin test was then widely used until replaced by more suitable tests not reliant on phenol and reflecting the conditions  in which modern disinfectants are used.\nCalculations by Harriette Chick showed that the killing of bacteria by disinfectants followed first order kinetics. So, the bactericidal activity of a particular disinfectant at a given concentration can be expressed as a constant (k) calculated by employing the formula k = N/C\u00b7T where N is the number of surviving cells, C is the concentration of agent applied and T is the time for which the agent is applied, so k is inversely proportional to dose (C\u00b7T is collectively called dose). \nOne way to compare disinfectants is to compare how well they do against a known disinfectant and rate them accordingly using the Phenol coefficient.

Prognostic markers are useful to stratify the patients into groups, guiding towards precise medicine discovery. The widely used prognostic markers in cancers include stage, size, grade, node and metastasis. In addition to these common markers, there are prognostic markers specific to different cancer types. For example estrogen level, progesterone and HER2 are markers specific to breast cancer patients. There is evidence showing that genes behaving as tumor suppressors or carcinogens could act as prognostic markers due to altered gene expression or mutation. Besides genetic biomarkers, there are also biomarkers that are detected in plasma or body fluid which can be metabolic or protein biomarkers.\nTraditional prognostic markers in oncology include tumor size, staging, lymph node spreading status, and metastasis. Large tumor, late staging, presence of cancer cells in multiple distant lymph nodes, and observation of metastasis often associate with poor prognosis.\nIn recent years, advances in molecular techniques, genomics, cancer biology and sequencing technology have provided opportunities to discover and validate new biomarkers for prognosis, particularly molecular prognostic markers. The newly developed prognostic biomarker can roughly be divided into DNA, epigenetic, RNA, signaling pathway, protein, and metabolic tumor biomarkers.\nDNA markers\nCarcinogenesis involves critical mutations on genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints which cause a normal cell to grow in an uncontrolled manner and thus DNA marker provide the first-hand information on carcinogenesis. DNA markers tend to be cancer type-specific, for instance, FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia, BRCA mutations in breast cancer, BRAF mutations in melanoma, and FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer. Detection of cancer hotspot mutations are made feasible by the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) that offers high-throughput sequencing of target amplicons.\nTable1: DNA prognostic markers for common cancer types\nFor liquid tumors, sufficient amount of DNA could be easily obtained since blood draw from patient is simple and noninvasive; for solid tumors, needle biopsy is often performed to collect tumor DNA, a process more invasive with limited DNA quantity for downstream analysis. An alternative DNA source is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA primarily originates from apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells that release their fragmented DNA into the circulation. It is believed that the amount of ctDNA in plasma is correlated with tumor progression and thus it has the potential to be utilized as a cancer prognostic marker. Collection of ctDNA is less invasive compared to tumor biopsy in that only a blood draw is need. But the challenge lies in extraction of ctDNA from total blood, the DNA quantity obtained, and methods to analyze highly fragmented ctDNA.\nEpigenetic markers\nEpigenetics are inheritable changes in gene expression that are not caused by alterations in DNA sequence. One of the most frequently seen prognostic markers is DNA methylation, primarily methylation of CpG islands, where cytosines in CpG dinucleotides can be methylated to form 5-methylcytosines. A panel of epigenetic methylation marker has been explored for prognosis of ovarian cancer, and it is reported that the panel exhibited high specificity and sensitivity (both above 70%) as a screen marker. Epigenetic markers have also shown promising potential as prognostic markers for bladder cancer.\nRNA markers\nWhile DNA sequence infers what the cells could possibly do, the expression profile indicates what is actually being done at a particular time point. Whether specific mRNA molecules exist and the degree at which they are expressed suggest whether a certain gene is \u201con\u201d and its expression level. Therefore, mRNA profiling could provide downstream transcriptional information about cancer in a more detailed and more timely manner. Technologies for mRNA profiling include RT-qPCR for highly sensitive analysis of few mRNA targets, microarrays for multiplexing profiling up to whole transcriptome level, and next generation RNA sequencing, i.e., RNA-seq, for analysis of all RNA molecules within a cancer cell (alternative splicing variants, mRNAs, noncoding RNAs and microRNAs).\nmRNA profiling panels have been established for breast cancer and other cancers as well. A set of 97-mRNA profile has achieved satisfactory molecular grading of breast cancer and has been commercialized as the MapQuant Dx Genomic Grade assay.\nProtein markers\nThe technique used for identifying protein markers in immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC staining of the intended protein markers are performed on tumor tissues and stained tissue would demonstrate the presence and distribution of the intended protein markers. The advantage of this technology is that it could provide morphological information about protein expression levels and the procedures are standardized and of low cost. However, assessment of IHC-stained tissue is less quantitative and are subject to bias. Besides, the number of validated protein markers for a certain type of cancer is limited.\nMetabolic markers\nMetabolites are potentially useful for predicting treatment response since they are the endpoint of many molecular pathways.

Occasionally the division is instead along both diagonals (party per saltire) again creating four parts but now at top, bottom, left, and right.\nAn example of party per cross is the Sovereign Arms of the United Kingdom, as used outside Scotland, which consists of four quarters, displaying the Arms of England, Scotland and Ireland, with the coat for England repeated at the end. (In the royal arms as used in Scotland, the Scottish coat appears in the first and fourth quarters and the English one second.).

These 323 quarterings include numerous repeated attributed arms assigned to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier.\nAnother example of a shield of many quarterings is the coat of arms of the Powys-Lybbe family, which contains 64 quarterings. Different rules apply in Scottish heraldry, and may well apply in other jurisdictions like Canada and South Africa.\nThe arms of the King of the United Kingdom are arms of dominion, which join together the arms of the ex-kingdoms now part of his kingdom.  However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent:  in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms.\nStrict rules apply in English Heraldry, both as to what arms may be displayed by way of quarterings, and the order in which they may be displayed.  Men and women are always entitled to display the arms of their paternal line but are not usually entitled to display by way of quartering the arms of families from whom there is descent only through a female line (for example, the arms of a mother or grandmother or great-grandmother).  An exception is made, however, if the female who breaks the male line of descent is a heraldic heiress\u2014a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have died without issue.  Such a woman is entitled to transmit her father's arms to her own children, who add them as a quartering.  If her father was himself entitled to one or more quarterings, these will pass to his daughters' children as quarterings as well.  Quarterings are displayed in the order in which they are acquired by a family by marriage, starting with those acquired by the earliest marriage to bring in quarterings.  It is permissible to omit quarterings, but if a quartering was brought in by a later quartering, it is essential to show the whole chain of quarterings leading to the quartering displayed, or else to omit the chain altogether.\nThe larger the number of quarterings, the smaller the space available for each coat of arms, so that most families entitled to many quarterings make a selection of those they ordinarily use.  The Duke of Norfolk, for example, uses only four quarterings, although he is entitled to many more. In Scotland in some cases the plain unquartered coat is the more prized, as entitlement to its use can indicate who is chief of the name and arms and holds the headship of a clan. For example, Flora Fraser, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy has arms as chief of Fraser\u2014the plain coat of 'azure, three fraises argent'\u2014and a 'private' quartered coat. The Powys-Lybbe family appear, likewise, to usually use only the quarterings of Powys and Lybbe.  However these are not true quarterings as the arms were changed in 1907 to be an impartible design of the two arms; the personal arms are precisely this design, with no quarterings despite its appearance. (If this were a quartering the following would apply: when only two different coats of arms are shown, each one is repeated twice in order to fill up the minimum number of four quarterings on such a display.)  Prior to the 1907 change, the family did quarter their arms with Lybbe but with the Powys arms in the top left quarter as these were the family arms; the new design has Lybbe in the top left as Lybbe is the last part of the name."}, "completions": [{"prefix": "Quartering is a method of joining several different coats of arms together in one shield by dividing the shield into equal parts and placing different coats of arms in each division.\n\n Typically, a quartering consists of a division into four equal parts, two above and two below (party per cross).

Excessive Spanish demands for tribute and labour caused a rebellion by the indigenous inhabitants, who attempted to starve out the Spanish. The conquistadores launched punitive raids, but the natives abandoned their towns and fled to inaccessible regions.

The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.\nStrauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their book Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991), which discusses the history of the United States as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584. In their book The Fourth Turning (1997), the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras to describe the history of the United States, including the Thirteen Colonies and their British antecedents. However, the authors have also examined generational trends elsewhere in the world and described similar cycles in several developed countries.\nAcademic response to the theory has been mixed, with some applauding Strauss and Howe for their \"bold and imaginative thesis\", while others have criticized the theory as being overly deterministic, unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who graduated from Harvard University with Strauss, called Generations the most stimulating book on American history he'd ever read, and even sent a copy to each member of Congress. The theory has been influential in the fields of generational studies, marketing, and business management literature. However, the theory has also been described by some historians and journalists as pseudoscientific, \"kooky\", and \"an elaborate historical horoscope that will never withstand scholarly scrutiny\".

Human societies are complex systems, as it were, human ecosystems. Early humans, as hunter-gatherers, recognized and worked within the parameters of the complex systems in nature and their lives were circumscribed by the realities of nature.  But they couldn't explain complex systems.  Only in recent centuries did the need arise to define complex systems scientifically.    Complex systems theories first developed in math in the late 19th century, then in biology in the 1920s to explain ecosystems, then to deal with artificial intelligence (cybernetics), to date, the direction of research on the evolution of intelligent systems has been identified .\nAnthropologist Gregory Bateson is the most influential and earliest propagator of systems theory in social sciences.  In the 1940s, as a result of the Macy conferences, he immediately recognized its application to human societies with their many variables and the flexible but sustainable balance that they maintain.  Bateson describes system as \"any unit containing feedback structure and therefore competent to process information.\" Thus an open system allows interaction between concepts and materiality or subject and the environment or abstract and real. In natural science, systems theory has been a widely used approach. Austrian biologist, Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy, developed the idea of the general systems theory (GST). The GST is a multidisciplinary approach of system analysis.\n\n"}, "completions": [{"prefix": "Systems theory in anthropology is an interdisciplinary, non-representative, non-referential, and non-Cartesian approach that brings together natural and social sciences to understand society in its complexity.

Bateson argued that all living organisms function as integrated systems, continuously interacting with their environments in a way that shapes their behavior and development. His concept of \"ecology of mind\" is a classic illustration of this principle, suggesting that mental processes, cultures, and ecosystems are all part of a larger, interconnected whole.\n\nAdditionally, systems theory has laid the groundwork for the development of related concepts such as cybernetics and autopoiesis.

It posits that societies function as dynamic entities composed of various subsystems, including economic, political, and kinship networks. Each of these subsystems interacts and evolves in response to internal and external stimuli, highlighting the complexity and interconnectedness of human behaviors and cultural manifestations.\n\nOne of the primary figures associated with systems theory in anthropology is Norbert Wiener, whose ideas on cybernetics laid the groundwork for understanding feedback loops and adaptation within social systems.

By focusing on relationships and feedback loops within and between systems, anthropologists can gain a deeper understanding of cultural practices, social structures, and symbolic meanings.\n\nOne key concept in systems theory is holism, which emphasizes the importance of studying systems as a whole rather than reducing them to their individual parts. This perspective allows anthropologists to explore how different elements within a system interact and influence each other, leading to emergent properties that cannot be understood by analyzing the parts in isolation. For example, in the study of kinship systems, anthropologists may examine how kinship ties shape social organization, economic practices, and religious beliefs within a culture.\n\nSystems theory also highlights the role of boundaries in defining systems and regulating the flow of information and energy."}, {"prefix": "Systems theory in anthropology is an interdisciplinary, non-representative, non-referential, and non-Cartesian approach that brings together natural and social sciences to understand society in its complexity.

Originally intended as a platform for actors to present adaptations from literature and agent showcases, the company quickly changed focus when Hutchinson moved on and Malony took over as the sole creative director.  The original idea behind the use of the word \"Tweed\" (Theaterworks Emerging in Experimental Directions) was to describe a concept for a production company that wove together different types of live performance. Tweed was one of the first theater companies to embrace performance art, make use of work from that arena, and produce it in off-off-Broadway theaters.\nTweed and Malony rapidly became a part of the thriving early 80s art movement in Manhattan's East Village. The company presented most of its early productions in the many performance clubs located downtown: Limbo Lounge, 8BC, Snafu, Darinka, Limelight, Cat Club, The Club at La MaMa, and most importantly, The Pyramid Club.  \nFor eleven years (1984-1995), the company produced a curated festival of new works\u2014the Tweed New Works Festival, which presented the early works of many of today's recognized theater artists.  Among these various productions, Malony presented the first incarnation of John Kelly's Obie-award-winning Pass the Blutwurst, Bitte, acclaimed writer Edgar Oliver's first theatrical work The Seven Year Vacation, and the performance ensemble Watchface.  He was the original producer of Bill Russell's Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens, which ran in London's West End, and Tony Winner Lisa Kron's actual first musical, Dykebar, The Musical.  \nHe directed Paved Paradise Redux (John Kelly's homage to Joni Mitchell) at the Abrons Arts Center and on tour (winner, best touring musical 2011, Austin Texas Critics Circle).\nMalony's other writing and directing credits during this time include Brenda Bergman's Her Reality and Endangered Species: The Brenda Bergman Story; Colleen O'Neill as Dr. Julia Wonder in Make My Dreams Your Reality, among many other Julia Wonder shows; drag chanteuse Varla Jean Merman's The Christmas Concert at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall; Tom Judson's Canned Ham at Dixon Place and on tour; and Joseph Keckler's Midnight Mass at Ars Nova.\nIn 1996, with longtime company members Stephen Pell and Colleen O'Neill, Malony launched the Tweed Fractured Classicks Series, which presented parodied classic plays and movies featuring unusual, comedic, and often cross-gender casting.  Over twenty Fractured Classicks productions have been launched since 1996.  The Tweed Fractured Classicks Series presented staged readings and full productions of classic American plays and films featuring unique casting choices.\nReviewing Tweed Fractured Classick \"The Mailman Always Comes Twice\" in 2002, Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times called the show was a \"ribald parody\" of The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Of Varla Jean Merman's leading performance as \"Nora Papadopolous,\" Genzlinger wrote, \"[she had] the Lana [Turner] look pegged pretty definitively, including the legs.\" Genzlinger described the show as \"simply hilarious\u2014a terrific, if indescribable, bit of staging.\"  Tweed Fractured Classicks received Cease and Desist requests for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Blow Out Your Candles, Laura (The Glass Menagerie), Jungle Red (The Women), and Whaddya Blind?! (Wait Until Dark), which was cancelled after threats from the author.\nMalony's longtime creative partner was dancer and choreographer John O'Malley, co-founder of Neo Labos Dance Theater, who died in 2007 after a long battle with AIDS.  O'Malley choreographed pieces for Tweed such as \"Hotel Martinique\" and \"Atomic Opera.\"\nTweed continued to thrive into the 2000s.  The long illness and ultimate death of O'Malley curtailed production activity for several months.  Around this time, Tweed began partnering with the Howl Festival to present Fractured Classicks and music series to raise money for Howl Help, a project of The Actors Fund.  Tweed's relationship with Howl Arts has remained active, and benefits supporting Howl Arts are produced regularly\u2014the most recent being Joni Mitchell: A Birthday Tribute at The Cutting Room in New York City.\nMalony has been curating the Tweed's Sundays & 7 series at Pangea for five years.  Longtime Tweed artist Carol Lipnik is a frequent performer, and Sundays @ 7 has been the venue where actor/writer David Cale has workshopped his autobiographical musical We Are Only Alive for a Short Amont of Time, which premiered at Chicago's Goodman Theater in Fall 2018.

They range in height from 9 feet (2.7 m) to the 94-foot (29 m) Ganoga Falls. Ricketts Glen State Park is named for R. Bruce Ricketts, a colonel in the American Civil War who owned over 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but spared the old-growth forests in the glens from clearcutting. The park, which opened in 1944, is administered by the Bureau of State Parks of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR). Nearly all of the waterfalls are visible from the Falls Trail, which Ricketts had built from 1889 to 1893 and which the state park rebuilt in the 1940s and late 1990s. The Falls Trail has been called \"the most magnificent hike in the state\" and one of \"the top hikes in the East\".\nThe waterfalls are on the section of Kitchen Creek that flows down the Allegheny Front, a steep escarpment between the Allegheny Plateau to the north and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The glens are made of sedimentary rocks from the Huntley Mountain and Catskill Formations that formed up to 370 million years ago in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods.
