The first such occurrence involved Tropical Storm One and Tropical Storm Two, which briefly coexisted in early August. Both systems struggled for organization due to competing atmospheric influences, but each was able to achieve some degree of maturity. While Tropical Storm One traveled along a relatively benign path to the north, Tropical Storm Two contributed to weather patterns along the eastern Caribbean, where residents were kept on alert as they monitored its potential for development.\n\nIn mid-September, this season's second notable overlap took place with the formation of Hurricane Five and Tropical Storm Three. Hurricane Five showcased powerful winds and a well-defined structure as it moved northwestward, resulting in widespread monitoring from meteorologists. Tropical Storm Three, on the other hand, existed further south, and while it showed promise for intensification, it ultimately remained a less significant system without severe impacts.

This was the first time that a major professional football league's playoff game was played in January rather than December.\nThe game matched the Eastern Division champion, the Houston Oilers (10\u20134), against the Western Division champion, the Los Angeles Chargers (10\u20134), in the first Championship Game of the new American Football League. The host Oilers were favored by 6-6\u00bd points.\nThe AFL established a format in which the right to host Championship Games would be alternated each year between the Western Division winners and the Eastern Division. This matched the tradition the established National Football League had adhered to for decades. In the NFL, which the AFL was directly competing against, the Eastern champion hosted title games in even-numbered years. To preclude the possibility of having to compete with an NFL title game in close proximity for an audience, AFL owners initially agreed that its Western champions would host in even numbered years, with Eastern champions hosting in odd numbered years.\nThus, the first game was originally scheduled to be played in the 103,000 capacity Los Angeles Coliseum. However, the Chargers had drawn less than 10,000 fans per home game. With the still-fledgling league fearing the prospect that ABC would pull its contract because of very poor ticket sales, the Chargers, the Oilers and the League mutally agreed to move the game  to the smaller Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, where it drew a near-capacity 32,183. It rained for five days straight prior to the game.\nOilers quarterback George Blanda, who had retired after ten seasons in the NFL and had not played in 1959, threw three touchdown passes, and kicked a field goal and three extra points to lead Houston to the AFL Championship by a score of 24\u201316.\nThe game was the last the Chargers would play as a Los Angeles team until the 2017 season, with the team playing the next 56 years in San Diego. Ultimately, the league opted to reverse its initial format, as such the Chargers (who repeated as Western champions) would host the next championship game in San Diego. Ultimately, the AFL's initial fear of having to locally compete with an NFL title game host for an audience and gate revenue never realized, since although the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders later hosted AFL championship games during the league's ten year run their local NFL rivals did not qualify for the postseason in any of those years."}, "completions": [{"prefix": "The 1960 American Football League Championship Game was the first AFL title game, played on New Year's Day 1961 at Jeppesen Stadium in Houston, Texas.
