Each storm displayed unique characteristics, contributing to the understanding of hurricane behavior, prediction, and monitoring that would enhance future forecasting techniques.\n\nTropical Storm One formed on August 5, quickly developing in intensity but remaining offshore throughout its lifespan. Observers noted a steady movement towards the northern Atlantic waters, where the cooler sea temperatures helped in facilitating its dissipation by August 10. Following this, Tropical Storm Two emerged on September 6, once again skirting the eastern coast but avoiding direct impacts on land. This pattern of storms forming and staying offshore would be a recurring theme throughout the season.\n\nIn contrast, Hurricane Four, formed by late September, presented a more challenging scenario. This storm exhibited considerable strength, reaching windspeeds of up to 100 mph. Although it remained offshore, meteorologists monitored it closely due to its proximity to land and the potential for rapid changes in intensity, drawing comparisons with historical hurricanes"
