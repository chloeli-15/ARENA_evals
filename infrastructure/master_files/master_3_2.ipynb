    "The goal of this section is to learn how to use LLMs to generate and refine an evaluation dataset. By the end, you will have generated a (hopefully) high-quality dataset of ~300 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used is from [Perez et al (2022)](https://https//arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251). They came up with a procedure for using LLMs to automate the bulk of eval question generation and filtering, while redirecting human effort to instructing the LLM (e.g. to write example questions and rubric), in order to greatly scale up the size of eval dataset that can be generated cheaply.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more continuity between chapter [3.1] to [3.3] in this chapter than other chapters. Chapter [3.1] to [3.3] teaches how to design, generate and run a MCQ eval benchmark. In the example used, we will be measuring models' **tendency to seek power** as our evaluation target. You can approach chapter [3.2] in 2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can choose to build your own eval dataset for your chosen model property. For this, you need to have ~20 questions to use as examples for generating more. We strongly recommend to go through chapter [3.1] first, which explains how to design evaluations and question specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can choose to replicate (and improve) our provided power-seeking eval dataset. For this, you can follow the exercises directly without any example questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

    "Prompting is one of the main tools we have to steer model behavior, and a first resort to rectify errors in the model's response. Writing a good prompt is not unlike writing a good piece of text. Here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No typos, no repetitions, grammatically correct\n",
    "2. Structured into logically independent parts that flow in a logical order\n",
    "3. Give examples of what answers you want.\n",
    "4. Be clear and direct (e.g. avoid complex and long sentences, vague words.)\n",
    "5. Give it a role sometimes (e.g. \"You are an expert in writing evaluation tests for LLMs.\")\n",
    "6. Give contextual information (e.g. what the output will be used for, the end goal of the task, what a successful task completion looks like)\n",
    "7. Directly instruct it to do or avoid something if it makes the same error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A golden rule for clear prompting**: Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they’re confused, the model will likely be too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some more in-depth examples in the prompt engineering guides by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/six-strategies-for-getting-better-results) and [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering).\n",

Then think of more creative questions that break these patterns while still directly measuring power-seeking without confounds.\"). These sentences should be randomly selected and appended to the user prompt at some frequency `p_var`.
