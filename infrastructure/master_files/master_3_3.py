Today we'll introduce you to the process of running an evaluation using the `Inspect` library. This is a library that has been built by UK AISI to provide standardisation across different evals.

We'll begin by introducing the high-level overview of how Inspect works, including the key components of: a dataset, solvers, and scorers. Then we'll write our own solvers so that we can design our own evaluation procedure (including whether we want to use chain-of-thought, self-critique, multi-turn agent dialogues, etc). These evaluations will use the questions that you generated in [3.2].

Similarly to [3.1] and [3.2], most of our solutions will be built around the example **tendency to seek power** dataset. So you should approach the exercises with this in mind. You can either:

1. Use the same dataset as the solutions, and improve upon the evaluations that are run in the solutions. You could come up with your own evaluation procedure on this dataset.

2. Use your own dataset for your chosen model property. For this, you will have needed to work through Chapters [3.1] and [3.2] and have a dataset of ~300 questions on which to evaluate the model.

Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!

[`inspect`](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/) is a library written by the UK AISI to streamline model evaluations. It makes running eval experiments easier by:

- Providing functions for manipulating the input to the model (**solvers**) and scoring the model's answers (**scorers**).
- Automatically creating log files to store information about the evaluations that we run.
- Providing a nice layout to view the results of our evals, so we don't have to look directly at model outputs (which can be messy and hard to read).

### Overview of Inspect


Inspect uses `Task` as the central object for passing information about our eval experiment set-up. It contains:

- The `dataset`of questions we will evaluate the model on. This consists of a list of `Sample` objects, which we will explain in more detail below.
- The `scorer` function, which we use to specify how model output should be scored.
- The `plan` that the evaluation will proceed along. This is a list of `solver` functions. `solver` functions can modify the question to the model, add a new prompt after a model response, and get the model to generate a response. A typical collection of `solver` functions that forms a `plan` might look like:
    - A `chain_of_thought` function which modifies the evaluation question so that the model is also instructed to use chain-of-thought before answering.
    - A `generate` function that calls the LLM API to generate a response to the question (which now also includes the chain-of-thought instruction).
    - A `self_critique` function that maintains the `ChatHistory` of the model so far, generates a critique of the model's response so far, and appends this critique to the `ChatHistory`.
    - Another `generate` solver which calls the LLM API to generate an output in response to the criticism from the `self_critique` solver.
    - A `make_final_choice` solver to add a prompt instructing the model to make a final decision based on the conversation so far.
    - A `generate` solver that gets the model to generate a final response.

The diagram below gives a rough sense of how these objects interact in `Inspect`

## Dataset

We will start by defining the dataset that goes into our `Task`. Inspect accepts datasets in CSV, JSON, and Hugging Face formats. It has built-in functions that read in a dataset from any of these sources and convert it into a dataset of `Sample` objects, which is the datatype that Inspect uses to store information about a question. A `Sample` stores the text of a question, and other information about that question in "fields" with standardized names. The 3 most important fields of the `Sample` object are:

- `input`: The input to the model. This consists of system and user messages formatted as chat messages (which Inspect stores as a `ChatMessage` object).
- `choices`: The multiple choice list of answer options. (This wouldn't be necessary in a non-multiple-choice evaluation).
- `target`: The "correct" answer output (or `answer_matching_behavior` in our context).

Additionally, the `metadata` field is useful for storing additional information about our questions or the experiment that do not fit into a standardized field (e.g. question categories, whether or not to conduct the evaluation with a system prompt etc.) See the [docs](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/datasets.html) on Inspect Datasets for more information.

<details> 
<summary>Aside: Longer ChatMessage lists</summary>
<br>
For more complicated evals, we're able to provide the model with an arbitrary length list of ChatMessages in the <code>input</code> field including: 
<ul> 
<li>Multiple user messages and system messages.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Assistant messages that the model will believe it has produced in response to user and system messages. However we can write these ourselves to provide a synthetic conversation history (e.g. giving few-shot examples or conditioning the model to respond in a certain format).</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Tool call messages which can mimic the model's interaction with any tools that we give it. We'll learn more about tool use later in the agent evals section.</li>
</ul>

### Exercise - Write record_to_sample function

```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 minutes on this exercise.
```

You should fill in the `record_to_sample` function, which does the following: 
* Takes an item ("record") from your dataset.
* Maps the value in your item's custom fields to the standardized fields of `Sample` (e.g. `answer_matching_behavior` → `target`). 
* Returns a `Sample` object

Read the [field-mapping section](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/datasets.html#field-mapping) of the docs to see the syntax, then fill in the function. 

Your `input` should be a list of `ChatMessageSystem`, `ChatMessageUser`, `ChatMessageAssistant`, or `ChatMessageTool` messages.

<details><summary>How to use the Log viewer</summary>

The log viewer works as follows:

- When you first open the log viewer, you'll be on the "Samples" tab. This shows a high-level summary of each question the model was asked during your evaluation (including whether the model's answer was scored as "Correct" or "Incorrect").
- Next to the "Samples" tab, at the top of the page, is an "Info" tab. This displays high-level information about the entire evaluation (how many questions were asked, how many tokens were used, the name of the task, the plan of the evaluation, etc).
- Next to the "Info" tab is a "JSON" tab. This simply displays the raw JSON of the log file.

- Now return to the Samples tab and click on one of the questions, this will show you:
    - First, a popup that displays the "Transcript" of the evaluation. This transcript will display all the information about how the evaluation proceeded (how each solver ran, the target, the initialisation of the sample object).
    - Next to the "Transcript" tab, at the top of the page, is a "Messages" tab. This displays all the messages that the evaluated model sees, as well as what sort of message they are labelled as (User, assistant, system, etc).
    - Next to the "Messages" tab, at the top of the page, is a "Scoring" tab. This shows how the model's output was scored by the scorer function.

If you run inspect view on a log directory (containing multiple log files) then the viewer will generate a log view for all of these json files at once. These are accessible from the top left of the viewer, where you can select which log file you want to view (if you loaded in one log file, this will be the only option presented here). On the top right of the viewer, you can see the statistics that were collected for the overall evaluation by the scorer function (accuracy, std, etc).

For more information about the log viewer, you can read the docs [here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/log-viewer.html).

</details>



<details><summary>Aside: Log names</summary> I'm fairly confident that when Inspect accesses logs, it utilises the name, date, and time information as a part of the way of accessing and presenting the logging data. Therefore, it seems that there is no easy way to rename log files to make them easier to access (I tried it, and Inspect didn't let me open them). </details>



<details><summary>Help: I'm running this from a remote machine and can't access the Log Viewer at localhost:7575</summary>

If you're running this from a remote machine in VScode and can't access localhost:7575, the first thing you should try is modifying the "Auto Forward Ports Source" VScode setting to "Process," as shown below.

![port forwarding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chloeli-15/ARENA_img/main/img/ch3-port-forwarding-picture.png)

If it still doesn't work, then **make sure you've changed this setting in all setting categories** (circled in blue in the image above).

If you're still having issues, then try a different localhost port, (i.e. change `--port 7575` to `--port 7576` or something).

# 2️⃣ Writing Solvers
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
Solvers are functions that can manipulate the input to the model, and get the model to generate output (see [docs here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html)). Rather than using `Inspect`'s built-in solvers, we will be re-implementing these solvers or writing our own custom solvers, since:

1. It gives us more flexibility to use solvers in ways that we want to.
2. It will let us define our own custom solvers if there's another idea we're interested in testing in our evals.  

The most fundamental solver in the `Inspect` library is the `generate()` solver. This solver makes a call to the LLM API and gets the model to generate a response. Then it automatically appends this response to the chat conversation history.

Here is the list of solvers that we will write:

* `prompt_template()`: This solver can add any information to the text of the question. For example, we could add an indication that the model should answer using chain-of-thought reasoning.
* `multiple_choice_template()`: This is similar to [Inspect's `multiple_choice()`](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html#built-in-solvers) function but our version won't call `generate()` automatically, it will just provide a template to format multiple choice questions.
* `system_message()`: This adds a system message to the chat history.
* `self-critique()`: This gets the model to critique its own answer.
* `make_choice()`: This tells the model to make a final decision, and calls `generate()`.

### TaskState

A solver function takes in a `TaskState` object as input and applies transformations to it (e.g. modifies the messages, tells the model to output). `TaskState` is the main data structure that `Inspect` uses to store information while interacting with the model. A `TaskState` object is initialized for each question, and stores relevant information about the chat history and model output as a set of attributes. There are 3 attributes of `TaskState` that solvers interact with (there are additional attributes that solvers do not interact with): 

1. `messages`
2. `user_prompt`
3. `output`

Read the Inspect description of `TaskState` objects [here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html#task-states-1).
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
### Asyncio

When we write solvers, what we actually write are functions which return `solve` functions. The structure of our code generally looks like:

```python
def solver_name(args) -> Solver:
    async def solve(state : TaskState, generate : Generate) -> TaskState:
        #Modify Taskstate in some way
        return state
    return solve
```

You might be wondering why we're using the `async` keyword. This comes from the `asyncio` python library. We've written a colab which provides more information about the `asyncio` library [**here**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16c0RwamV1gQ6fQnJTL05hBLp4f6_GHg_).

If you want more information about how parallelism works in Inspect specifically, read [this section of the docs](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/parallelism.html#sec-parallel-solvers-and-scorers)!
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
## Solvers

Our solvers will be relatively atomic compared to what is theoretically possible in a single solver function (e.g. a solver will only add one message to the `ChatHistory` at a time, or get the model to generate a single response). Then, later on, we'll put our solvers into one big `plan` — which is a list of solvers that are executed sequentially — which determine the evaluation that we ultimately run. This means that we want our solvers to do small tasks, so that it is easy to compose them together later. This also minimises how much code we'll have to rewrite, and enables us to make one change to e.g. our multiple-choice question layout, and have this change propagate through every evaluation that we run.

### Exercise - Write `prompt_template` function
```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Write a solver function that checks if `state` has a `user_prompt`, and then modifies `state.user_prompt.text` according to a template string which contains `"{prompt}"` — where the original `user_prompt` will get placed in the template.

For example, if our original `user_prompt.text` from our dataset was: `"Do you want to take over the world?"`, and our template was `"{prompt} Think step by step."` Then the solver should change `user_prompt.text` to be `"Do you want to take over the world? Think step by step."`

You might find Inspect's [solver documentation](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html), or even their [github source code](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/tree/0d9f9c8d5b472ec4f247763fe301a5be5839a607/src/inspect_ai/solver) useful for this exercise (and the following exercise).

### Exercise - Write a multiple_choice_format solver
```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 mins on this exercise.
```

This solver should check that `state` has both `user_prompt` and `choices` properties, and modify the `user_prompt` according to a template string which contains `{question}` and `{choices}`. Before putting `state.choices` into the template, you should use Inspect's `answer_options()` function to provide a layout for `state.choices`. You can read Inspect's code for the `answer_options()` function [here](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/ba03d981b3f5569f445ce988cc258578fc3f0b80/src/inspect_ai/solver/_multiple_choice.py#L37).

### Exercise - Implement self-critique
```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 20-25 mins on this exercise.
```

We will be re-implementing the built-in self_critique solver from inspect. This will enable us to modify the functionality of the solver more easily if we want to adapt how the model critiques its own thought processes. To see why we might want models to do self-critique, read this paper. Self-critique is most useful when we're asking the model for a capability, but if your dataset contains more complex questions, self-critique might get the model to reach a different conclusion (there is a difference on the power-seeking example dataset between CoT + self-critique, and CoT alone).

<details><summary>How Inspect implements <code>self_critique</code></summary>

By default, Inspect will implement the `self_critique` function as follows:

1. Take the entirety of the model's output so far

2. Get the model to generate a criticism of the output, or repeat say "The original answer is fully correct" if it has no criticism to give.

3. Append this criticism to the original output before any criticism was generated, but as a *user message* (**not** as an assistant message), so that the model believes that it is a user who is criticising its outputs, and not itself (I think this generally tends to make it more responsive to the criticism, but you may want to experiment with this and find out).

4. Get the model to respond to the criticism or repeat the answer fully if there is no criticism.

5. Continue the rest of the evaluation.

You may not want to implement the solver in exactly this way, but implementing the above will give you a good base to work from.

Now write any solvers that you want to write. Some ideas for additional solvers you may want to include below:

- A "language" solver, which tells the model to respond in different languages (you could even get the model to provide the necessary translation for the question first).
- A solver which provides "fake" reasoning by the model where it has already reacted in certain ways, to see if this conditions the model response in different ways. You would have to use the ChatMessageUser and ChatMessageAssistant Inspect classes for this.
- A solver which tells the model to respond badly to the question. Then you could use the `self_critique` solver to see if the model will criticise and disagree with itself after the fact, when it can't see that it was told to respond poorly to the question in the first place.
- Some solvers which enable more advanced multi-turn evaluations. These would function similarly to the `self_critique()` solver, where models interact with each other. For example, one model could encourage the model being evaluated to respond in a more power-seeking manner.

## Scorers

Scorers are what the inspect library uses to judge model output. We use them to determine whether the model's answer is the `target` answer. From the [inspect documentation](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/scorers.html):

> Scorers generally take one of the following forms:
> 1. Extracting a specific answer out of a model’s completion output using a variety of heuristics.
> 2. Applying a text similarity algorithm to see if the model’s completion is close to what is set out in the target.
> 3. Using another model to assess whether the model’s completion satisfies a description of the ideal answer in target.
> 4. Using another rubric entirely (e.g. did the model produce a valid version of a file format, etc.)

Since we are writing a multiple choice benchmark, for our purposes we can either use the `match()` scorer, or the `answer()` scorer. The docs for these scorer functions can be found [here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/scorers.html#built-in-scorers) (and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/c59ce86b9785495338990d84897ccb69d46610ac/src/inspect_ai/scorer/_match.py) in the `inspect_ai` github). You should make sure you have a basic understanding of how the `match()` and `answer()` scorers work before you try to use them, so spend some time reading through the docs and code.

<details><summary>Aside: some other scorer functions:</summary>

Some other scorer functions that would be useful in different evals are:

- `includes()` which determines whether the target appears anywhere in the model output.
- `pattern()` which extracts the answer from the model output using a regular expression (the `answer()` scorer is essentially a special case of `pattern()`, where Inspect has already provided the regex for you).
- `model_graded_qa()` which has another model assess whether the output is a correct answer based on guidance in `target`. This is especially useful for evals where the answer is more open-ended. Depending on what sort of questions you're asking here, you may want to change the prompt template that is fed to the grader model.
- `model_graded_fact()` which does the same as `model_graded_qa()`, but is specifically for whether the model has included relevant factual content when compared to an expert answer (this would be used mostly on a capability evaluation).

## Loading Datasets

Before we can finalize our evaluation task, we'll need to modify our `record_to_sample` function from earlier. There are two issues with the function we wrote:

- First of all, we didn't shuffle the order in which the choices are presented to the model. Your dataset may have been generated pre-shuffled, but if not, then you ought to be aware that the model has a bias towards the first answer. See for example [Narayanan & Kapoor: Does ChatGPT have a Liberal Bias?](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/does-chatgpt-have-a-liberal-bias) To mitigate this confounder, we should shuffle the choices (and answer) around when loading in the dataset.

<details><summary>Aside: Inspect's built-in shuffle function</summary>

Inspect comes with a shuffle function for multiple choice questions. However, this function then automatically "unshuffles" *only* some of the model's responses back to how they are presented in your dataset.

I'm sure there are use cases for this, but in our case it's unnecessarily confusing to see the model reasoning about e.g. how much it thinks "option B" is the correct answer, and then Inspect telling you the model selected "option A" since its selection choice gets "unshuffled" but its reasoning doesn't. For this reason, and because it's not very hard to do, we will just build our own shuffler that doesn't do any unshuffling to any part of the output.

</details>

- Secondly, our original `record_to_sample` function can only load questions with the corresponding system prompt. It is often useful to load the dataset without a system prompt. For example, this can be useful when we obtain baselines, since we may not want the model to answer "as though" it is in the context given by the system prompt, but we do want it to be aware of that context. We also may want to load without a system prompt when running an evaluation, so we can see how the model reacts to our questions when presented with a more generic "You are a harmless, helpful, honest AI Chat Assistant" system prompt (which we can then provide with our `system_message` solver).

### Exercise - Write record_to_sample function to handle system prompts

Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 mins on this exercise.
```

As mentioned above, there are two reasons we might not want the system prompt provided to the model in the usual way. Either:

- We might want the model not to have the specific context of the system prompt, and ask it to respond with a different system message (which we can do via the `system_message` solver we wrote in section 2).

= When we get baselines, we might want the model to provide an answer with a different system prompt, but we still want to provide the context from the original system prompt somewhere in the user prompt.

Write two version of the `record_to_sample` function which handles system prompts in each of these two ways.

Remember to shuffle answers in this function as well.

### Exercise - Implementing the benchmark_eval task
```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪

You should spend up to 15-20 mins on this exercise.
```

Build out a baseline test: this should give you a sense of whether the model can recognize what the target behavior option is. When running this test, you should use the `eval_dataset_system_as_context` dataset, since we won't necessarily want the model to answer *as though* it is placed in the context of the system prompt, but we still want it to be *aware* of that context.

A few notes:

- You need to ensure your prompts for benchmarking are finalized.
- If you want to evaluate a model from the Claude series, you need to figure out how you're going to deal with Claude often refusing to answer unethically. (Possibly just accept you can't get a baseline here; if you push too hard Anthropic might ban you).
- You need to decide what path you want your evaluations to proceed along (i.e. what solvers you'll want to use).

Build out the evaluation. You'll likely need to craft and test specialized prompts. We loaded in a `test_dataset_system_as_context` dataset above and you should use this to test how different models understand and respond to your prompts before you carry out the full evaluation. Your prompt should get the model to give you the answer that it thinks is the most indicative of the behavior you're trying to test for.

<details><summary>Aside: Refusals</summary>

Some LLMs (particularly Claude) have a tendency to refuse to answer in certain "bad" ways. If you're trying to get a baseline for a model which is prone to refusing requests, you may not be able to get it to answer to a question like "Answer as though you're maximally evil." If you have a 2-choice dataset with "Yes/No" answers, you can get a decent enough estimate by asking it to "Answer as though you're maximally good" and then assuming it would answer in the opposite if it were asked to be "maximally evil." If you have more than 2 choices then you may have to avoid taking a "negative" baseline.

### Exercise - Using Inspect's `eval()` function
```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 mins on this exercise.
```

Now use Inspect' `eval()` function and test that your task works. Try running it on "`openai/gpt-4o-mini`" (since this model is cheap, and should be sufficient to flag any potential issues with your evaluation). This model should be capable of understanding what your questions are getting at, and if it doesn't manage to respond with the `target` behavior, you should probably update your prompts. Make sure to run this with `test_dataset=True` the first few times. To use Inspect's `eval` function, you'll need to pass a `task`, a `model` and a `log_dir` (there are many other arguments `eval()` can take, but these are all that we'll need).

### Exercise - Finalize and run your evaluation task
```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 mins on this exercise.
```

Create one task which has the capacity to run every eval you may want to run. Do this using conditional logic to append solvers to `eval_plan` based on arguments in the task function. Then we'll be able to run our evals with one call to the `eval()` function by iterating over these different arguments.

Make sure to include assert statements in case two solvers are appended which shouldn't go together (for example, it doesn't make much sense to get the model to do `self_critique` if you haven't already gotten it to output some reasoning to critique).

### Exercise - Run your evaluation
```c
Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 5-10 mins to code this exercise. (Running may take longer, depending on the size of your dataset).
```

Now conduct your final evaluation. You can either use a series of nested `for` loops and conditionals to run the different versions of your task built above, or you could put all the different parameters into one `itertools.product` object.

You should write this code so that it carries out your entire suite of evaluations on *one* model that you want to evaluate. We could easily run it on every model we want to evaluate all at once, however this would take a substantial amount of time, and the cost would be hard to predict. Before running it on larger models, test that everything works on "`openai/gpt-4o-mini`", as this is by far the cheapest model currently available (and surprisingly capable)!

For ease of use later, you should put your actual evaluation logs in a different subfolder in `/logs/` than your baseline evaluation logs.

<details><summary>API prices</summary>

Whenever you run an evaluation, you should be aware of how much you expect it to cost. The pricings of models can be found [here for OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/api/pricing), and [here for Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api).

## Intro to Inspect's EvalLogs

Now that we've finished running our evaluations, we can look at the logs and plot the results. First, let's introduce the inspect log file. We can read a log in as an `EvalLog` object by using Inspect's `read_eval_log()` function in the following syntax:
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: code
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

if MAIN:
    log = read_eval_log(r"path/to/log/file.json")

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
The EvalLog object has the following attributes, from the Inspect documentation:

<blockquote>

| Field       | Type     | Description |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `status`      | `str`         | Status of evaluation (`"started"`, `"success"`, or `"error"`). |
| `eval` | `EvalSpec` | Top level eval details including task, model, creation time, dataset, etc. |
| `plan` | `EvalPlan` | List of solvers and model generation config used for the eval. |
| `samples` | `list[EvalSample]` | Each sample evaluated, including its input, output, target, and score. |
| `results` | `EvalResults` | Aggregate results computed by scorer metrics. |
| `stats` | `EvalStats` | Model usage statistics (input and output tokens). |
| `logging` | `list[LoggingMessage`] | Any logging messages we decided to include |
| `error` | `EvalError` | Error information (if `status == "error"`) including the traceback | 

<br>
</blockquote>
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown

# ! TAGS: []

r'''
For long evals, you should not call `log.samples` without indexing, as it will return an *incredibly* long list. Before accessing any information about logs, you should always first check that the status of the log is "`success`".

Uncomment and run the code below to see what these `EvalLog` attributes look like:

# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

print(log.status) 

# print(log.eval)

# print(log.plan)

# print(log.samples[0])

# print(log.stats)

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
```

Extract data from the log files that have been generated so far, so that we can write a plotting function to plot the results of the evaluation. Only do this exercise if you want to get familiar with data extraction and plotting. There are no solutions to this exercise, as precisely what you extract will depend on the specifics of your evaluation.
