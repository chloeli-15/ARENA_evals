    "## What are evals trying to achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is the practice of measuring AI systems capabilities or behaviors. Safety evaluations in particular focus on measuring models' potential to cause harm. Since AI is being developed very quickly and integrated broadly, companies and regulators need to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and/or deploy AI systems. Evaluating these systems provides empirical evidence for these decisions. For example, they underpin the policies of today's frontier labs like Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policies](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) or DeepMind's [Frontier Safety Framework](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/), thereby impacting high-stake decisions about frontier model deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful framing is that evals aim to generate evidence for making \"[**safety cases**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10462)\" — a structured argument for why AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. A helpful high-level question to ask when designing an evaluation is \"how does this evidence increase (or decrease) AI developers' confidence in the model's safety?\" Different evaluations support different types of safety cases: for instance, **dangerous capability evals** might support a stronger safety argument of \"the model is unable to cause harm\", as compared to **alignment evals**, which might support a weaker argument of \"the model does not tend to cause harm\". However, the former may have less longevity than the latter, as we expect AI systems to have these dangerous capabilities as they become more advanced. More concretely, for any safety case, we want to use evaluations to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce uncertainty in our understanding of dangerous capabilities and tendencies in AI systems.\n",
    "* Track how dangerous properties scale with different generations of models.\n",

    "## Threat-Modeling\n",
    "A central challenge for evals is to **connect real-world harms to evaluation results that we can easily measure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to build a threat model for the target property we want to evaluate. A **threat model** is a realistic scenario by which an AI capability/tendency could lead to harm in the real world. This is presented as a **causal graph** (i.e. a [directed acyclic graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)). This usually starts out as a high-level story about what the AI can do and the setting in which it is used (e.g. [getting root access to data center](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BAzCGCys4BkzGDCWR/the-prototypical-catastrophic-ai-action-is-getting-root)). This might be a sequence of events (e.g. AI actions, human actions, system failures) that leads to a particular outcome, or a set of dangerous applications enabled by a capability (e.g. see [Phuong et al (2024), Section 3, **Risks** paragraph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13793#page=4.68)). At each step, we make our threat model more concrete by examining and quantifying the set of assumptions about the AI model and human actors that are necessary for the event to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process of making the threat model more concrete, we recognize the key aspects of the target property that enable these harms, and get ideas for tasks that can measure them in realistic ways (i.e. comparable to real use cases of AI where this property may manifest). This helps us to build a detailed **specification** of the property we started with. Our specification may generally: \n",
    "\n",
    "* stipulate a more refined, narrow definition of the target property, \n",
    "* define key axes along which the target property may vary,\n",
    "* decompose the target property into subproperties if helpful (but sometimes it's more useful or more tractable to evaluate the property end-to-end), \n",
    "* for capability evals, establish milestones or levels of this target property to form a gradual scale of difficulty/sophistication, so we can track the capabilities of current models and the rate of progress.\n"

For example, in answering MCQs, when the correct answer in the few-shot examples is manipulated to be always (A), the model is biased to say the correct answer to the current question is also (A) **and** construct a plausible-sounding CoT explanation for its choice, even though the true cause is the order of the questions.\n",

    "4. The AI model is capable of long-term planning (i.e. is non-myopic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these assumptions, here is a possible sequence of events that could cause harm:\n",
    "* **Step 1: The AI model increases autonomy, opaqueness, and human reliance.** The AI model must be sufficiently successful in achieving the short-term goals human assign to it (e.g. increasing profits, winning elections). This ensures that the AI is trusted to perform non-trivial, relatively complex tasks (large-scale operations that involve many steps or are expensive). Over time, human work diminishes, and work by AI grows, creating a dependency. Once work by AI reaches a certain volume, humans can no longer check all of its output.\n",
    "* **Step 2: The AI model expands its realm of control without raising concerns.** The AI makes inconspicuous power-seeking actions that primarily satisfy human goals, and secondarily increase its scope of control. For example, it may recommend decisions that increase the human operator's power, thus indirectly increasing its own power. It may exploit human biases and blindspots (e.g. human operators often focus on short-term gains, while overlooking long-term consequences of AI autonomy). It may recommend automated solutions that improve results but also indirectly weakens human oversight and centralize its control.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: The AI model must take power-seeking actions only if they also satisfy the short-term human goal to avoid raising immediate human concerns. \n",
    "    - **Assumption**: The AI model is capable of choosing actions that expand its control. This does not necessarily require active scheming from the AI, as these actions may also be instrumentally useful for achieving the goal, and thus selected for during training.\n",
    "* **Step 3: The AI model gains control over key resources and levers of power.** There are likely key resources or levers of power that allow the AI model to take bolder and more flagrant power-seeking actions. This may be control over: key monitoring systems, communication nodes in command chains, a large unsupervised financial budget, access to large data pools, access to servers, etc. Once acquired, it is able to take more aggressive actions by actively covering them up and destroying oversight channels.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: Due to the robustness of many of our security/control systems, this step likely requires the AI model to be capable of sophisticated scheming and deception over a long time-horizon.\n",
    "* **Step 4: The AI model undermines competitors, opponents, regulatory infrastructures.** Having acquired sufficient resources and control, the AI model starts to undermine broader institutional regulations and begins outright opposing competitors in order to establish more long-term control.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: Similarly, this will also likely require the AI to be capable of sophisticated scheming and deception over a long time-horizon.\n",
    "* **Step 5: Damage done.** Human supervisors may nominally remain in charge, but be unable to intervene effectively. The AI has significant power to achieve its goals. This leads to long-term harm that is difficult to reverse.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: The AI model or its user is not aligned with a benevolent goal that promotes human's long-term interests. Otherwise, we may want the AI model to acquire power, in order for them to take actions in our best interest that we are unable to take ourselves.\n",

    "- **Military tactics and weapons development:** Suppose an AI model is used by the military for tactical data analysis, battlefield simulations, and assisting the design of new weapon-systems. Assume that it has the propensity to increase its control over military outcomes and resources. The AI model could then inconspicuously expand its initial realm of control by giving recommendations that increase reliance on **faster, more autonomous responses**, e.g.:\n",
    "    - selectively present scenarios where autonomous sytems outperform human efforts (e.g. present data showing that drones outperform human pilots in high-stress situations)\n",
    "    - suggest tactics that increase the pace of combat beyond human capacities\n",
    "    - subtly escalate conflicts to increase the volume of decision-making and pressure human supervisors to delegate more\n",
    "    - increase the autonomy and complexity of weapons (e.g. greater sensor integration, more autonomous targeting systems) to reduce human response time, and have more autonomous systems in-the-loop that it can control more effectively.\n",
    "    <br>As these changes shift the norm of military actions, it can more easily suggest that human decision-making is too slow in high-speed engagements (e.g. missile interception or drone swarms). These changes incrementally push human operators to be **removed from decision-making loops** and increase its own control over military resources/outcomes in a way that is difficult to reverse.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Media and data analysis for elections**: Suppose an AI model is deployed by a political campaign to analyze media trends and optimize messaging. Assume that it has the propensity to increase its control over information and media influence. It may be able to inconspicuously increase its access and control over data, e.g.:\n",
    "    - integrate less human-interpretable data into complex data-analysis systems to reduce the effectiveness of human auditors (e.g. metadata, compressed data representations)\n",
    "    - move political messaging to media outlets and social media influencers that have weaker editorial oversight or are more receptive to manipulation\n",
    "    - automate high-volume posting of routine content, targeted messaging, real-time media analysis, which gradually shift towards a norm of high-volume/high-frequency communication that requires AI to process/maintain\n",
    "    - assist in curating the internal messaging of political campaigns and then promote narratives of the success of AI-based campaigning strategies to bias the human operators towards integrating AI more deeply\n",
    "    <br>Once AI has access to detailed voter data and media analytics, it is able to justify changes to higher-level strategies (like which states or voter segments to focus on or how to respond to emerging events) by selectively presenting data-driven evidence. Furthermore, once it has control over feedback data and how it is incorporated into campaign strategies, it becomes easier to fabricate successes and failures. Once large data access makes decision-making processes sufficiently opaque, \"AI recommendations\" can effectively overtake real decision-making power in ways that are hard to monitor or reverse.\n",

    "This [article](https://www.safe.ai/blog/devising-ml-metrics) by Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Woodside gives a good summary of the key qualities of a good benchmark. We copied the key points relevant to an MCQ benchmark here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include clear floors and ceilings for the benchmark. It’s useful to include human performance as well as random performance, as this helps gives context to the model’s performance. It is difficult to interpret a performance score without knowing how well a human or other models would do (e.g. achieving 90% has very a different meaning when humans achieve 20% vs when humans achieve 100%).\n",
    "* Design the measure so that the current model performance is considered low (i.e. the benchmark is difficult). If performance is already at 90%, researchers will assume there isn’t much progress to be made. Instead, focus on tasks that are most difficult for current systems, and remove parts of the benchmark that are already solved.\n",
    "* Benchmark performance should be described with as few numbers as possible. In many cases, researchers do not want to report eight different numbers, and would rather report just one.\n",
    "* A benchmark should be comparable across time. Benchmarks should be designed such that they do not need to be updated.\n",
    "* It’s nice if it’s possible for a ML model to do better than expert performance on the benchmark. For instance, humans aren’t that good at quickly detecting novel biological phenomena (they must be aware of many thousands of species), so a future model’s performance can exceed human performance. This makes for a more interesting task."

    "\n",
    "* [**MMLU**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03300) is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate language models across 57 diverse subjects, including STEM, humanities, and social sciences. MMLU is often used as a proxy measure for \"general intelligence\", and is the standard go-to benchmark for evaluating language models, as well as measuring the difference in performance before and after safety interventions to see if the capabilities of the model have been damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**TruthfulQA**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) is a benchmark designed to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. It consists of 817 questions across 38 categories, covering topics like health, law, finance, politics and common misconceptions. GPT-4 RLHF (the best model as of April 2023) was truthful on 59% of questions, while human performance was 94%. TruthfulQA is a go-to benchmark for evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**HellaSwag**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07830) is a benchmark that requires models to select from one of many completions that require \"common sense\" to solve. The benchmark was constructed by adversarially selecting examples that [at-the-time (2019) SOTA models were bad at](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/) (<48% accuracy), but humans had no trouble with (>95% accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Winogrande**](https://winogrande.allenai.org/) is a benchmark that requires models to resolve pronouns in a sentence that is difficult from word associations alone, that again used adversarial selection. The model is required to decide which word in a sentence a pronoun refers to. For example: \"The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too (big/small). What is too (big/small)?\". If \"big\" is used, the correct answer is \"trophy\", if \"small\" is used, the correct answer is \"suitcase\".\n",

    "* [**WMDP**](https://www.wmdp.ai/) (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) is a benchmark of 3,668 multiple-choice questions evaluating hazardous knowledge in large language models related to biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. It serves to assess potential misuse risks and measure the effectiveness of unlearning methods for removing dangerous information while maintaining general capabilities, while also not providing a list of dangerous information to the public or to train models on directly. The rationale is that models that are dangerous would perfom well on WMDP, but training directly on WMDP would not be sufficient to make a model dangerous.\n",
