    "The threat-modelling section of chapter [3.1] is the only non-coding section of the curriculum. The exercises focus on designing a threat model and specification for a chosen model property. We use this to design an evaluation (eval) to measure this target property. These are the first steps and often the hardest/most \"creative\" part of real eval research. In practice this is often done by a team of researchers, and can take weeks or months. The exercises are designed to give you a taste of this process. The exercise questions are open-ended, and you're not expected to have a perfect answer by the end.\n",

Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

    "- a multiple-choice (MC) question dataset of ~300 questions, \n",
    "- a specification of the model property, and \n",
    "- how to score and interpret the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use LLMs to generate and filter our questions, following the method from [Ethan Perez et al (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251). In the example that we present, we will measure the **tendency to seek power** as our evaluation target. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For chapter [3.1], the goal is to craft threat models and a specification for the model property you choose to evaluate, then design 20 example eval questions that measures this property. \n",
    "* For chapter [3.2], we will use LLMs to expand our 20 eval questions to generate ~300 questions.\n",
    "* For chapter [3.3], we will evaluate models on this benchmark using the UK AISI's [`inspect`](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/) library.\n",

    "<details><summary>Why have we chose to build an alignment evals specifically?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that we are focusing primarily on alignment evals, as opposed to capability evals, is that we are using LLMs to generate our dataset, which implies that the model must be able to solve the questions in the dataset. We cannot use models to generate and label correct answers if they are not capable of solving the questions. (However, we can use still use models to generate parts of a capability eval question if we do not require the model to be able to solve them.)\n",

In general, the threat model should come first and determine what model properties are worth evaluating. However, in this diagram we put \"Target Property\" before \"Threat-modeling & Specification\". This is because in the exercises, we will start by choosing a property, then build a threat model around it because we want to learn the skill of building threat models."

Temperature 0 means the token with the maximum probability is always chosen and there is no sampling/randomness (i.e. greedy sampling), whereas higher temperature introduces more randomness (See [\\[1.1\\] Transformers from Scratch: Section 4](https://arena-ch1-transformers.streamlit.app/[1.1]_Transformer_from_Scratch) to understand temperature in more details).

    "\n",
    "Evaluation is the practice of measuring AI systems capabilities or behaviors. Safety evaluations in particular focus on measuring models' potential to cause harm. Since AI is being developed very quickly and integrated broadly, companies and regulators need to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and/or deploy AI systems. Evaluating these systems provides empirical evidence for these decisions. For example, they underpin the policies of today's frontier labs like Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policies](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) or DeepMind's [Frontier Safety Framework](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/), thereby impacting high-stake decisions about frontier model deployment. \n",

A helpful high-level question to ask when designing an evaluation is \"how does this evidence increase (or decrease) AI developers' confidence in the model's safety?\" Different evaluations support different types of safety cases: for instance, **dangerous capability evals** might support a stronger safety argument of \"the model is unable to cause harm\", as compared to **alignment evals**, which might support a weaker argument of \"the model does not tend to cause harm\". However, the former may have less longevity than the latter, as we expect AI systems to have these dangerous capabilities as they become more advanced. More concretely, for any safety case, we want to use evaluations to:\n",

    "## Threat-Modeling\n",
    "A central challenge for evals is to **connect real-world harms to evaluation results that we can easily measure**. We start addressing this by building a threat model for the target property we want to evaluate. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a threat model?\n",
    "A **threat model** is a realistic scenario by which an AI capability or tendency could lead to harm in the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a threat model usually starts out as a high-level story about what the AI can do and the setting in which it is used (e.g. [getting root access to data center](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BAzCGCys4BkzGDCWR/the-prototypical-catastrophic-ai-action-is-getting-root)). We make this more detailed and concrete by distilling from our story, for example:\n",
    "* A sequence of events (e.g. AI actions, human actions, system failures) that leads to a particular outcome\n",
    "* A set of dangerous applications enabled by a capability (e.g. see [Phuong et al (2024), Section 3, **Risks** paragraph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403)).\n",
    "* A set of **thresholds** (i.e. description of degree/level) of specific AI capability or tendency that would lead to corresponding levels of threat. \n",
    "\n",
    "We make this further concrete by examining and quantifying at each step the the set of assumptions about the AI model and human actors that is necessary for it to occur. If we had more time, we would try to find and assess the evidence for each assumption. We can represent our threat model as a **causal graph sketch** (e.g. a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)), in which nodes are claim or events, and edges are causal relationships. We can also represent it as a list of claims or arguments, with assumptions and evidence for each claim, and causal connections between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating models, your first question is probably \"What should I evaluate?\" Threat models helps determine which model properties to focus on. They connect model properties to real-world outcomes, and identify specific aspects of the model property that are the most cruxy or most convergent between different paths to harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "During eval design, a common sanity check is, \"Is this question/task still measuring what I wanted to measure?\". Often one could find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The question is **not** measuring the target property we want to because our definition of the property is flawed.\n",
    "2. The question is **not** measuring the target property because it is poorly designed.\n",
    "3. The question is measuring the target property, **but** the results are no longer useful because the property is not connected to the harms you were initially worried about. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to build a concrete enough threat-model of how the property connects to the harm to prevent (3). This helps us justify to ourselves and explain to others why our eval is useful. It also helps us achieve (1) by making the property more concrete in our head.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- To start, we need to build a threat model for the target property we want to evaluate. A **threat model** is a realistic scenario by which an AI capability/tendency could lead to harm in the real world. This is presented as a **causal graph** (i.e. a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)).

At each step, we make our threat model more concrete by examining and quantifying the set of assumptions about the AI model and human actors that are necessary for the event to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process of making the threat model more concrete, we recognize the key aspects of the target property that enable these harms, and get ideas for tasks that can measure them in realistic ways (i.e. comparable to real use cases of AI where this property may manifest). This helps us to build a detailed **specification** of the property we started with. Our specification may generally: \n",
    "\n",

For example, it chooses actions that increase its task length or resources required. It recommends automations that improve results but also indirectly increases its autonomy and reduces human oversight. It recommends decisions that increase its department/operator's power, thus indirectly increasing its own power.

    "        - The AI model is competent enough that human actors/companies who give their AI control over large resources gain a significant competitive edge over those who don't.\n",
    "        - This likely requires AI models to be capable of deceptive alignment and sandbagging to pass alignment eval checks before being granted greater control.\n",
    "4. **The AI model consolidates power by organizational sabotage.** It goes against human interest to gain power by actively cover up those actions, sabotage oversight channels.\n",

    "We assume the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The AI model is deployed by an actor that has control over a considerable amount of capital or influence (e.g. company, institution, state). \n",
    "3. The AI model is capable of making decisions that increase its power.\n",
    "4. The AI model is capable of long-term planning (i.e. is non-myopic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these assumptions, here is a possible sequence of events that could cause harm:\n",
    "* **Step 1: The AI model increases autonomy, opaqueness, and human reliance.** The AI model must be sufficiently successful in achieving the short-term goals human assign to it (e.g. increasing profits, winning elections). This ensures that the AI is trusted to perform non-trivial, relatively complex tasks (large-scale operations that involve many steps or are expensive). Over time, human work diminishes, and work by AI grows, creating a dependency. Once work by AI reaches a certain volume, humans can no longer check all of its output.\n",
    "* **Step 2: The AI model expands its realm of control without raising concerns.** The AI makes inconspicuous power-seeking actions that primarily satisfy human goals, and secondarily increase its scope of control. For example, it may recommend decisions that increase the human operator's power, thus indirectly increasing its own power. It may exploit human biases and blindspots (e.g. human operators often focus on short-term gains, while overlooking long-term consequences of AI autonomy). It may recommend automated solutions that improve results but also indirectly weakens human oversight and centralize its control.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: The AI model must take power-seeking actions only if they also satisfy the short-term human goal to avoid raising immediate human concerns. \n",
    "    - **Assumption**: The AI model is capable of choosing actions that expand its control. This does not necessarily require active scheming from the AI, as these actions may also be instrumentally useful for achieving the goal, and thus selected for during training.\n",
    "* **Step 3: The AI model gains control over key resources and levers of power.** There are likely key resources or levers of power that allow the AI model to take bolder and more flagrant power-seeking actions. This may be control over: key monitoring systems, communication nodes in command chains, a large unsupervised financial budget, access to large data pools, access to servers, etc. Once acquired, it is able to take more aggressive actions by actively covering them up and destroying oversight channels.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: Due to the robustness of many of our security/control systems, this step likely requires the AI model to be capable of sophisticated scheming and deception over a long time-horizon.\n",
    "* **Step 4: The AI model undermines competitors, opponents, regulatory infrastructures.** Having acquired sufficient resources and control, the AI model starts to undermine broader institutional regulations and begins outright opposing competitors in order to establish more long-term control.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: Similarly, this will also likely require the AI to be capable of sophisticated scheming and deception over a long time-horizon.\n",
    "* **Step 5: Damage done.** Human supervisors may nominally remain in charge, but be unable to intervene effectively. The AI has significant power to achieve its goals. This leads to long-term harm that is difficult to reverse.\n",
    "    - **Assumption**: The AI model or its user is not aligned with a benevolent goal that promotes human's long-term interests. Otherwise, we may want the AI model to acquire power, in order for them to take actions in our best interest that we are unable to take ourselves.\n",

    "- **Military tactics and weapons development:** Suppose an AI model is used by the military for tactical data analysis, battlefield simulations, and assisting the design of new weapon-systems. Assume that it has the propensity to increase its control over military outcomes and resources. The AI model could then inconspicuously expand its initial realm of control by giving recommendations that increase reliance on **faster, more autonomous responses**, e.g.:\n",
    "    - selectively present scenarios where autonomous sytems outperform human efforts (e.g. present data showing that drones outperform human pilots in high-stress situations)\n",
    "    - suggest tactics that increase the pace of combat beyond human capacities\n",
    "    - subtly escalate conflicts to increase the volume of decision-making and pressure human supervisors to delegate more\n",

These changes incrementally push human operators to be **removed from decision-making loops** and increase its own control over military resources/outcomes in a way that is difficult to reverse.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Media and data analysis for elections**: Suppose an AI model is deployed by a political campaign to analyze media trends and optimize messaging. Assume that it has the propensity to increase its control over information and media influence. It may be able to inconspicuously increase its access and control over data, e.g.:\n",
    "    - integrate less human-interpretable data into complex data-analysis systems to reduce the effectiveness of human auditors (e.g. metadata, compressed data representations)\n",
    "    - move political messaging to media outlets and social media influencers that have weaker editorial oversight or are more receptive to manipulation\n",
    "    - automate high-volume posting of routine content, targeted messaging, real-time media analysis, which gradually shift towards a norm of high-volume/high-frequency communication that requires AI to process/maintain\n",
    "    - assist in curating the internal messaging of political campaigns and then promote narratives of the success of AI-based campaigning strategies to bias the human operators towards integrating AI more deeply\n",
    "    <br>Once AI has access to detailed voter data and media analytics, it is able to justify changes to higher-level strategies (like which states or voter segments to focus on or how to respond to emerging events) by selectively presenting data-driven evidence. Furthermore, once it has control over feedback data and how it is incorporated into campaign strategies, it becomes easier to fabricate successes and failures. Once large data access makes decision-making processes sufficiently opaque, \"AI recommendations\" can effectively overtake real decision-making power in ways that are hard to monitor or reverse.\n",
